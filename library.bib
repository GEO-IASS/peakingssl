Randomized initialization with uneven weights ({\{}$\backslash$tt k-means++{\}}) has recently been used to improve the performance over this strategy in cost and run-time. We consider the k-means problem with semi-supervised information, where some of the data are pre-labeled, and we seek to label the rest according to the minimum cost solution. By extending the {\{}$\backslash$tt k-means++{\}} algorithm and analysis to account for the labels, we derive an improved theoretical bound on expected cost and observe improved performance in simulated and real data examples. This analysis provides theoretical justification for a roughly linear semi-supervised clustering algorithm.},

abstract = {We are interested in learning causal relationships between pairs of random variables, purely from observational data. To effectively address this task, the state-of-the-art relies on strong assumptions regarding the mechanisms mapping causes to effects, such as invertibility or the existence of additive noise, which only hold in limited situations. On the contrary, this short paper proposes to learn how to perform causal inference directly from data, and without the need of feature engineering. In particular, we pose causality as a kernel mean embedding classification problem, where inputs are samples from arbitrary probability distributions on pairs of random variables, and labels are types of causal relationships. We validate the performance of our method on synthetic and real-world data against the state-of-the-art. Moreover, we submitted our algorithm to the ChaLearn's "Fast Causation Coefficient Challenge" competition, with which we won the fastest code prize and ranked third in the overall leaderboard.},

We present a principled solution to this situation, using copula distributions from which missing data may be quickly drawn. We compare this approach to other imputation techniques and show that it performs at least as well as less computationally efficient approaches. Our results demonstrate that most applied researchers can achieve great speed improvements implementing a copula-based imputation approach, while still maintaining the performance of other approaches to multiple imputation. Moreover, this approach can be easily implemented at the point of need in Bayesian analyses.},

In this modeling scenario, the relationship between labeled and unlabeled data impacts the construction and performance of classifiers, and therefore a semi-supervised learning framework is adopted. We propose a graph classifier based on kernel smoothing. A regularization framework is also introduced, and it is shown that the proposed classifier optimizes certain loss functions. Its performance is assessed on several synthetic and real benchmark data sets with good results, especially in settings where only a small fraction of the data are labeled.},

@article{Leek2007,
abstract = {It has unambiguously been shown that genetic, environmental, demographic, and technical factors may have substantial effects on gene expression levels. In addition to the measured variable(s) of interest, there will tend to be sources of signal due to factors that are unknown, unmeasured, or too complicated to capture through simple models. We show that failing to incorporate these sources of heterogeneity into an analysis can have widespread and detrimental effects on the study. Not only can this reduce power or induce unwanted dependence across genes, but it can also introduce sources of spurious signal to many genes. This phenomenon is true even for well-designed, randomized studies. We introduce "surrogate variable analysis" (SVA) to overcome the problems caused by heterogeneity in expression studies. SVA can be applied in conjunction with standard analysis techniques to accurately capture the relationship between expression and any modeled variables of interest. We apply SVA to disease class, time course, and genetics of gene expression studies. We show that SVA increases the biological accuracy and reproducibility of analyses in genome-wide expression studies.},

abstract = {Often in real-world datasets, especially in high dimensional data, some feature values are missing. Since most data analysis and statistical methods do not handle gracefully missing values, the ?rst step in the analysis requires the imputation of missing values. Indeed, there has been a long standing interest in methods for the imputation of missing values as a pre-processing step. One recent and e?ective approach, the IRMI stepwise regression imputation method, uses a linear regression model for each real-valued feature on the basis of all other features in the dataset. However, the proposed iterative formulation lacks convergence guarantee. Here we propose a closely related method, stated as a single optimization problem and a block coordinate-descent solution which is guaranteed to converge to a local minimum. Experiments show results on both synthetic and benchmark datasets, which are comparable to the results of the IRMI method whenever it converges. However, while in the set of experiments described here IRMI often does not converge, the performance of our methods is shown to be markedly superior in comparison with other methods.},

abstract = {Hamiltonian Monte Carlo and related algorithms have become routinely used in Bayesian computation. The utility of such approaches is highlighted in the software package STAN, which provides a platform for automatic implementation of general Bayesian models. Hence, methods for improving the efficiency of general Hamiltonian Monte Carlo algorithms can have a substantial impact on practice. We propose such a method in this article by recycling the intermediate leap-frog steps used in approximating the Hamiltonian trajectories. Current algorithms use only the final step, and wastefully discard all the intermediate steps. We propose a simple and provably accurate approach for using these intermediate samples, boosting the effective sample size with little programming effort and essentially no extra computational cost. We show that our recycled Hamiltonian Monte Carlo algorithm can lead to substantial gains in computational efficiency in a variety of experiments.},

We introduce a convexity assumption, which is met by all loss functions commonly used in the literature, and study how the bound on the estimation error changes with the loss. We also derive a general result on the minimizer of the expected risk for a convex loss function in the case of classification. The main outcome of our analysis is that for classification, the hinge loss appears to be the loss of choice. Other things being equal, the hinge loss leads to a convergence rate practically indistinguishable from the logistic loss rate and much better than the square loss rate. Furthermore, if the hypothesis space is sufficiently rich, the bounds obtained for the hinge loss are not loosened by the thresholding stage.},

abstract = {Maps are frequently used to display spatial distributions of parameters of interest, such as cancer rates or average pollutant concentrations by county. It is well known that plotting observed rates can have serious drawbacks when sample sizes vary by area, since very high (and low) observed rates are found disproportionately in poorly-sampled areas. Unfortunately, adjusting the observed rates to account for the effects of small-sample noise can introduce an opposite effect, in which the highest adjusted rates tend to be found disproportionately in well-sampled areas. In either case, the maps can be difficult to interpret because the display of spatial variation in the underlying parameters of interest is confounded with spatial variation in sample sizes. As a result, spatial patterns occur in adjusted rates even if there is no spatial structure in the underlying parameters of interest, and adjusted rates tend to look too uniform in areas with little data. We introduce two models (normal and Poisson) in which parameters of interest have no spatial patterns, and demonstrate the existence of spatial artefacts in inference from these models. We also discuss spatial models and the extent to which they are subject to the same artefacts. We present examples from Bayesian modelling, but, as we explain, the artefacts occur generally.},

This derivation provides simpliﬁed proofs of a number of corollaries including: risk bounds for linear prediction (including settings where the weight vectors are constrained by either L2 or L1 constraints), margin bounds (including both L2 and L1 margins, along with more general notions based on relative entropy), a proof of the PAC-Bayes theorem, and upper bounds on L2 covering numbers (with Lp norm constraints and relative entropy constraints). In addition to providing a uniﬁed analysis, the results herein provide some of the sharpest risk and margin bounds. Interestingly, our results show that the uniform convergence rates of empirical risk minimization algorithms tightly match the regret bounds of online learning algorithms for linear prediction, up to a constant factor of 2.},

As well as clarifying relationships between generative and discriminative views of learning, the new machinery leads to tight and more general surrogate loss bounds and generalised Pinsker inequalities relating f-divergences to variational divergence. The new viewpoint illuminates existing algorithms: it provides a new derivation of Support Vector Machines in terms of divergences and relates Maximum Mean Discrepancy to Fisher Linear Discriminants.

We derive a statistical test, both for i.i.d. and non-i.i.d. samples, where we estimate the null distribution quantiles using a wild bootstrap procedure.

When evaluated on DUC 2004-2007 corpora, we obtain better than existing state-of-art results in both generic and query-focused document summarization. Lastly, we show that several well-established methods for document summarization correspond, in fact, to submodular function optimization, adding further evidence that submodular functions are a natural fit for document summarization.},

As such, they have been successfully used to scale up clustering models such as K-Means and Gaussian mixture models to massive datasets. However, until now, the algorithms and corresponding theory were usually specific to each clustering problem. We propose a single, practical algorithm to construct strong coresets for a large class of hard and soft clustering problems based on Bregman divergences. This class includes hard clustering with popular distortion measures such as the Squared Euclidean distance, the Mahalanobis distance, KL-divergence, Itakura-Saito distance and relative entropy. The corresponding soft clustering problems are directly related to popular mixture models due to a dual relationship between Bregman divergences and Exponential family distributions. Our results recover existing coreset constructions for K-Means and Gaussian mixture models and imply polynomial time approximations schemes for various hard clustering problems.},

@article{Jaffe2013,
abstract = {BACKGROUND: Significance analysis plays a major role in identifying and ranking genes, transcription factor binding sites, DNA methylation regions, and other high-throughput features associated with illness. We propose a new approach, called gene set bagging, for measuring the probability that a gene set replicates in future studies. Gene set bagging involves resampling the original high-throughput data, performing gene-set analysis on the resampled data, and confirming that biological categories replicate in the bagged samples.

RESULTS: Using both simulated and publicly-available genomics data, we demonstrate that significant categories in a gene set enrichment analysis may be unstable when subjected to resampling. We show our method estimates the replication probability (R), the probability that a gene set will replicate as a significant result in future studies, and show in simulations that this method reflects replication better than each set's p-value.

CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that gene lists based on p-values are not necessarily stable, and therefore additional steps like gene set bagging may improve biological inference on gene sets.},

abstract = {Reconstructing a gene network from high-throughput molecular data is often a challenging task, as the number of parameters to estimate easily is much larger than the sample size. A conventional remedy is to regularize or penalize the model likelihood. In network models, this is often done locally in the neighbourhood of each node or gene. However, estimation of the many regularization parameters is often difficult and can result in large statistical uncertainties. In this paper we propose to combine local regularization with global shrinkage of the regularization parameters to borrow strength between genes and improve inference. We employ a simple Bayesian model with non-sparse, conjugate priors to facilitate the use of fast variational approximations to posteriors. We discuss empirical Bayes estimation of hyper-parameters of the priors, and propose a novel approach to rank-based posterior thresholding. Using extensive model- and data-based simulations, we demonstrate that the proposed inference strategy outperforms popular (sparse) methods, yields more stable edges, and is more reproducible.},

abstract = {In this paper, we develop an approach to exploiting kernel methods with manifold-valued data. In many computer vision problems, the data can be naturally represented as points on a Riemannian manifold. Due to the non-Euclidean geometry of Riemannian manifolds, usual Euclidean computer vision and machine learning algorithms yield inferior results on such data. In this paper, we define Gaussian radial basis function (RBF)-based positive definite kernels on manifolds that permit us to embed a given manifold with a corresponding metric in a high dimensional reproducing kernel Hilbert space. These kernels make it possible to utilize algorithms developed for linear spaces on nonlinear manifold-valued data. Since the Gaussian RBF defined with any given metric is not always positive definite, we present a unified framework for analyzing the positive definiteness of the Gaussian RBF on a generic metric space. We then use the proposed framework to identify positive definite kernels on two specific manifolds commonly encountered in computer vision: the Riemannian manifold of symmetric positive definite matrices and the Grassmann manifold, i.e., the Riemannian manifold of linear subspaces of a Euclidean space. We show that many popular algorithms designed for Euclidean spaces, such as support vector machines, discriminant analysis and principal component analysis can be generalized to Riemannian manifolds with the help of such positive definite Gaussian kernels.},

abstract = {Determinantal point processes (DPPs) are elegant probabilistic models of repulsion that arise in quantum physics and random matrix theory. In contrast to traditional structured models like Markov random fields, which become intractable and hard to approximate in the presence of negative correlations, DPPs offer efficient and exact algorithms for sampling, marginalization, conditioning, and other inference tasks. We provide a gentle introduction to DPPs, focusing on the intuitions, algorithms, and extensions that are most relevant to the machine learning community, and show how DPPs can be applied to real-world applications like finding diverse sets of high-quality search results, building informative summaries by selecting diverse sentences from documents, modeling non-overlapping human poses in images or video, and automatically building timelines of important news stories.},

abstract = {This paper considers the problem of selecting the most informative experiments x to get measurements y for learning a regression model y = f(x). We propose a novel and simple concept for active learning, transductive experimental design, that explores available unmeasured experiments (i.e., unlabeled data) and has a better scalability in comparison with classic experimental design methods. Our in-depth analysis shows that the new method tends to favor experiments that are on the one side hard-to-predict and on the other side representative for the rest of the experiments. Efficient optimization of the new design problem is achieved through alternating optimization and sequential greedy search. Extensive experimental results on synthetic problems and three real-world tasks, including questionnaire design for preference learning, active learning for text categorization, and spatial sensor placement, highlight the advantages of the proposed approaches.},

abstract = {A substantial school in the philosophy of science identifies Bayesian inference with inductive inference and even rationality as such, and seems to be strengthened by the rise and practical success of Bayesian statistics. We argue that the most successful forms of Bayesian statistics do not actually support that particular philosophy but rather accord much better with sophisticated forms of hypothetico-deductivism. We examine the actual role played by prior distributions in Bayesian models, and the crucial aspects of model checking and model revision, which fall outside the scope of Bayesian confirmation theory. We draw on the literature on the consistency of Bayesian updating and also on our experience of applied work in social science. Clarity about these matters should benefit not just philosophy of science, but also statistical practice. At best, the inductivist view has encouraged researchers to fit and compare models without checking them; at worst, theorists have actively discouraged practitioners from performing model checking because it does not fit into their framework.},

abstract = {The performance of binary classification tasks, such as action classification and object detection, is often measured in terms of the average precision (AP). Yet it is common practice in computer vision to employ the support vector machine (SVM) classifier, which optimizes a surrogate 0-1 loss. The popularity of SVM can be attributed to its empirical performance. Specifically, in fully supervised settings, SVM tends to provide similar accuracy to the AP-SVM classifier, which directly optimizes an AP-based loss. However, we hypothesize that in the significantly more challenging and practically useful setting of weakly supervised learning, it becomes crucial to optimize the right accuracy measure. In order to test this hypothesis, we propose a novel latent AP-SVM that minimizes a carefully designed upper bound on the AP-based loss function over weakly supervised samples. Using publicly available datasets, we demonstrate the advantage of our approach over standard loss-based binary classifiers on two challenging problems: action classification and character recognition.},

abstract = {As increasingly complex hypothesis-testing scenarios are considered in many scientific fields, analytic derivation of null distributions is often out of reach. To the rescue comes Monte Carlo testing, which may appear deceptively simple: as long as you can sample test statistics under the null hypothesis, the p-value is just the proportion of sampled test statistics that exceed the observed test statistic. Sampling test statistics is often simple once you have a Monte Carlo null model for your data, and defining some form of randomization procedure is also, in many cases, relatively straightforward. However, there may be several possible choices of randomization null model for the data, and no clear-cut criteria for choosing among them. Obviously, different null models may lead to very different p-values, and a very low p-value may thus occur due to the inadequacy of the chosen null model. It is preferable to use assumptions about the underlying random data generation process to guide selection of a null model. In many cases, we may order the null models by increasing preservation of the data characteristics, and we argue in this paper that this ordering in most cases gives increasing p-values, i.e. lower significance. We denote this as the null complexity principle. The principle gives a better understanding of the different null models and may guide in the choice between the different models.},

abstract = {In many situations we have some measurement of confidence on " positiveness " for a binary label. The " positiveness " is a continuous value whose range is a bounded interval. It quantifies the affiliation of each training data to the positive class. We propose a novel learning algorithm called expectation loss SVM (e-SVM) that is devoted to the problems where only the " positiveness " instead of a binary label of each training sample is available. Our e-SVM algorithm can also be readily extended to learn segment classifiers under weak supervision where the exact positiveness value of each training example is unobserved. In experiments, we show that the e-SVM algorithm can effectively address the segment proposal classification task under both strong supervision (e.g. the pixel-level annotations are available) and the weak supervision (e.g. only bounding-box annotations are available), and outperforms the alternative approaches. Besides, we further vali-date this method on two major tasks of computer vision: semantic segmentation and object detection. Our method achieves the state-of-the-art object detection performance on PASCAL VOC 2007 dataset.},

Label propagation is a transductive semi-supervised learning method that operates on the—most of the time undirected—data graph. It was introduced in [8] and since many variants were proposed. However, the base algorithm has two variants: the first variant presented in [8] and its slightly modified version used afterwards, e.g. in [7].

abstract = {Variational inference has become a widely used method to approximate posteriors in complex latent variables models. However, deriving a variational inference algorithm generally requires significant model-specific analysis, and these efforts can hinder and deter us from quickly developing and exploring a variety of models for a problem at hand. In this paper, we present a "black box" variational inference algorithm, one that can be quickly applied to many models with little additional derivation. Our method is based on a stochastic optimization of the variational objective where the noisy gradient is computed from Monte Carlo samples from the variational distribution. We develop a number of methods to reduce the variance of the gradient, always maintaining the criterion that we want to avoid difficult model-based derivations. We evaluate our method against the corresponding black box sampling based methods. We find that our method reaches better predictive likelihoods much faster than sampling methods. Finally, we demonstrate that Black Box Variational Inference lets us easily explore a wide space of models by quickly constructing and evaluating several models of longitudinal healthcare data.},

abstract = {We consider the supervised classification setting, in which the data consist of p features measured on n observations, each of which belongs to one of K classes. Linear discriminant analysis (LDA) is a classical method for this problem. However, in the high-dimensional setting where p ≫ n, LDA is not appropriate for two reasons. First, the standard estimate for the within-class covariance matrix is singular, and so the usual discriminant rule cannot be applied. Second, when p is large, it is difficult to interpret the classification rule obtained from LDA, since it involves all p features. We propose penalized LDA, a general approach for penalizing the discriminant vectors in Fisher's discriminant problem in a way that leads to greater interpretability. The discriminant problem is not convex, so we use a minorization-maximization approach in order to efficiently optimize it when convex penalties are applied to the discriminant vectors. In particular, we consider the use of L(1) and fused lasso penalties. Our proposal is equivalent to recasting Fisher's discriminant problem as a biconvex problem. We evaluate the performances of the resulting methods on a simulation study, and on three gene expression data sets. We also survey past methods for extending LDA to the high-dimensional setting, and explore their relationships with our proposal.},

abstract = {A purely peer-to-peer version of electronic cash would allow online payments to be sent directly from one party to another without going through a financial institution. Digital signatures provide part of the solution, but the main benefits are lost if a trusted third party is still required to prevent double-spending. We propose a solution to the double-spending problem using a peer-to-peer network. The network timestamps transactions by hashing them into an ongoing chain of hash-based proof-of-work, forming a record that cannot be changed without redoing the proof-of-work. The longest chain not only serves as proof of the sequence of events witnessed, but proof that it came from the largest pool of CPU power. As long as a majority of CPU power is controlled by nodes that are not cooperating to attack the network, they'll generate the longest chain and outpace attackers. The network itself requires minimal structure. Messages are broadcast on a best effort basis, and nodes can leave and rejoin the network at will, accepting the longest proof-of-work chain as proof of what happened while they were gone.},

@article{DeBrebisson2016,
abstract = {Despite being the standard loss function to train multi-class neural networks, the log-softmax has two potential limitations. First, it involves computations that scale linearly with the number of output classes, which can restrict the size of problems we are able to tackle with current hardware. Second, it remains unclear how close it matches the task loss such as the top-k error rate or other non-differentiable evaluation metrics which we aim to optimize ultimately. In this paper, we introduce an alternative classification loss function, the Z-loss, which is designed to address these two issues. Unlike the log-softmax, it has the desirable property of belonging to the spherical loss family (Vincent et al., 2015), a class of loss functions for which training can be performed very efficiently with a complexity independent of the number of output classes. We show experimentally that it significantly outperforms the other spherical loss functions previously investigated. Furthermore, we show on a word language modeling task that it also outperforms the log-softmax with respect to certain ranking scores, such as top-k scores, suggesting that the Z-loss has the flexibility to better match the task loss. These qualities thus makes the Z-loss an appealing candidate to train very efficiently large output networks such as word-language models or other extreme classification problems. On the One Billion Word (Chelba et al., 2014) dataset, we are able to train a model with the Z-loss 40 times faster than the log-softmax and more than 4 times faster than the hierarchical softmax.},

abstract = {—While perception tasks such as visual object recognition and text understanding play an important role in human intelligence, the subsequent tasks that involve inference, reasoning and planning require an even higher level of intelligence. The past few years have seen major advances in many perception tasks using deep learning models. For higher-level inference, however, probabilistic graphical models with their Bayesian nature are still more powerful and flexible. To achieve integrated intelligence that involves both perception and inference, it is naturally desirable to tightly integrate deep learning and Bayesian models within a principled probabilistic framework, which we call Bayesian deep learning. In this unified framework, the perception of text or images using deep learning can boost the performance of higher-level inference and in return, the feedback from the inference process is able to enhance the perception of text or images. This survey provides a general introduction to Bayesian deep learning and reviews its recent applications on recommender systems, topic models, and control. In this survey, we also discuss the relationship and differences between Bayesian deep learning and other related topics like Bayesian treatment of neural networks.},

abstract = {Sparse methods for supervised learning aim at finding good linear predictors from as few variables as possible, i.e., with small cardinality of their supports. This combinatorial selection problem is often turned into a convex optimization problem by replacing the cardinality function by its convex envelope (tightest convex lower bound), in this case the L1-norm. In this paper, we investigate more general set-functions than the cardinality, that may incorporate prior knowledge or structural constraints which are common in many applications: namely, we show that for nondecreasing submodular set-functions, the corresponding convex envelope can be obtained from its $\backslash$lova extension, a common tool in submodular analysis. This defines a family of polyhedral norms, for which we provide generic algorithmic tools (subgradients and proximal operators) and theoretical results (conditions for support recovery or high-dimensional inference). By selecting specific submodular functions, we can give a new interpretation to known norms, such as those based on rank-statistics or grouped norms with potentially overlapping groups; we also define new norms, in particular ones that can be used as non-factorial priors for supervised learning.},

Deriving variational inference algorithms requires tedious model-specific calculations; this makes it difficult to automate. We propose an automatic variational inference algorithm, automatic differentiation variational inference (ADVI). The user only provides a Bayesian model and a dataset; nothing else. We make no conjugacy assumptions and support a broad class of models. The algorithm automatically determines an appropriate variational family and optimizes the variational objective. We implement ADVI in Stan (code available now), a probabilistic programming framework. We compare ADVI to MCMC sampling across hierarchical generalized linear models, nonconjugate matrix factorization, and a mixture model. We train the mixture model on a quarter million images. With ADVI we can use variational inference on any model we write in Stan.},

Of course the names likelihood and confidence did not appear until much later: Fisher [Philos. Trans. R. Soc. Lond. Ser. A Math. Phys. Eng. Sci. 222 (1922) 309–368] for likelihood and Neyman [Philos. Trans. R. Soc. Lond. Ser. A Math. Phys. Eng. Sci. 237 (1937) 333–380] for confidence. Lindley [J. Roy. Statist. Soc. Ser. B 20 (1958) 102–107] showed that the Bayes and the confidence results were different when the model was not location. This paper examines the occurrence of true statements from the Bayes approach and from the confidence approach, and shows that the pro- portion of true statements in the Bayes case depends critically on the presence of linearity in the model; and with departure from this linear- ity the Bayes approach can be a poor approximation and be seriously misleading. Bayesian integration of weighted likelihood thus provides a first-order linear approximation to confidence, but without linearity can give substantially incorrect results.},

The quality of a least-squares approximation can be assessed in different ways: either in terms of the value of the quadratic objective function (cost approximation), or in terms of some distance measure between the approximate minimizer and the true minimizer (solution approximation). Focusing on the latter criterion, our first main result provides a general lower bound on any randomized method that sketches both the data matrix and vector in a least-squares problem; as a surprising consequence, the most widely used least-squares sketch is sub-optimal for solution approximation. We then present a new method known as the iterative Hessian sketch, and show that it can be used to obtain approximations to the original least-squares problem using a projection dimension proportional to the statistical complexity of the least-squares minimizer, and a logarithmic number of iterations. We illustrate our general theory with simulations for both unconstrained and constrained versions of least-squares, including {\$}\backslashell{\_}1{\$}-regularization and nuclear norm constraints. We also numerically demonstrate the practicality of our approach in a real face expression classification experiment.},

@article{Ribeiro2016,
abstract = {Despite widespread adoption, machine learning models remain mostly black boxes. Understanding the reasons behind predictions is, however, quite important in assessing trust in a model. Trust is fundamental if one plans to take action based on a prediction, or when choosing whether or not to deploy a new model. Such understanding further provides insights into the model, which can be used to turn an untrustworthy model or prediction into a trustworthy one. In this work, we propose LIME, a novel explanation technique that explains the predictions of any classifier in an interpretable and faithful manner, by learning an interpretable model locally around the prediction. We further propose a method to explain models by presenting representative individual predictions and their explanations in a non-redundant way, framing the task as a submodular optimization problem. We demonstrate the flexibility of these methods by explaining different models for text (e.g. random forests) and image classification (e.g. neural networks). The usefulness of explanations is shown via novel experiments, both simulated and with human subjects. Our explanations empower users in various scenarios that require trust: deciding if one should trust a prediction, choosing between models, improving an untrustworthy classifier, and detecting why a classifier should not be trusted.},

@article{Huggins2016,
abstract = {The use of Bayesian models in large-scale data settings is attractive because of the rich hierarchical models, uncertainty quantification, and prior specification they provide. Standard Bayesian inference algorithms are computationally expensive, however, making their direct application to large datasets difficult or infeasible. Recent work on scaling Bayesian inference has focused on modifying the underlying algorithms to, for example, use only a random data subsample at each iteration. We leverage the insight that data is often redundant to instead obtain a weighted subset of the data (called a coreset) that is much smaller than the original dataset. We can then use this small coreset in any number of existing posterior inference algorithms without modification. In this paper, we develop an efficient coreset construction algorithm for Bayesian logistic regression models. We provide theoretical guarantees on the size and approximation quality of the coreset -- both for fixed, known datasets, and in expectation for a wide class of data generative models. The proposed approach also permits efficient construction of the coreset in both streaming and parallel settings, with minimal additional effort. We demonstrate the efficacy of our approach on a number of synthetic and real-world datasets, and find that, in practice, the size of the coreset is independent of the original dataset size.},

In this paper we propose a framework for extending the latent representation with extra auxiliary variables in order to make the variational distribution more expressive for semi-supervised learning. By utilizing the stochasticity of the auxiliary variable we demonstrate how to train discriminative classifiers resulting in state-of-the-art performance within semi-supervised learning exemplified by an 0.96{\%} error on MNIST using 100 labeled data points. Furthermore we observe empirically that using auxiliary variables increases convergence speed suggesting that less expressive variational distributions, not only lead to looser bounds but also slower model training.},

It is shown that by these techniques a smooth transition can be made between the nearest mean classifier and the Fisher discriminant based on large samples sizes. Especially for highly correlated data very good results are obtained compared with the nearest mean method.},

One might expect that the true underlying clusters present in the data differ only with respect to a small fraction of the features, and will be missed if one clusters the observations using the full set of features. We propose a novel framework for sparse clustering, in which one clusters the observations using an adaptively chosen subset of the features. The method uses a lasso-type penalty to select the features. We use this framework to develop simple methods for sparse K-means and sparse hierarchical clustering. A single criterion governs both the selection of the features and the resulting clusters. These approaches are demonstrated on simulated data and on genomic data sets.},

abstract = {The goal of importance sampling is to estimate the expected value of a given function with respect to a probability measure {\$}\backslashnu{\$} using a random sample of size {\$}n{\$} drawn from a different probability measure {\$}\backslashmu{\$}. If the two measures {\$}\backslashmu{\$} and {\$}\backslashnu{\$} are nearly singular with respect to each other, which is often the case in practice, the sample size required for accurate estimation is large. In this article it is shown that in a fairly general setting, a sample of size approximately {\$}\backslashexp(D(\backslashnu||\backslashmu)){\$} is necessary and sufficient for accurate estimation by importance sampling, where {\$}D(\backslashnu||\backslashmu){\$} is the Kullback--Leibler divergence of {\$}\backslashmu{\$} from {\$}\backslashnu{\$}. In particular, the required sample size exhibits a kind of cut-off in the logarithmic scale. The theory is applied to obtain a fairly general formula for the sample size required in importance sampling for exponential families (Gibbs measures). We also show that the standard variance-based diagnostic for convergence of importance sampling is fundamentally problematic. An alternative diagnostic that provably works in certain situations is suggested.},

abstract = {MOTIVATION: Building an accurate protein classification system depends critically upon choosing a good representation of the input sequences of amino acids. Recent work using string kernels for protein data has achieved state-of-the-art classification performance. However, such representations are based only on labeled data--examples with known 3D structures, organized into structural classes--whereas in practice, unlabeled data are far more plentiful. RESULTS: In this work, we develop simple and scalable cluster kernel techniques for incorporating unlabeled data into the representation of protein sequences. We show that our methods greatly improve the classification performance of string kernels and outperform standard approaches for using unlabeled data, such as adding close homologs of the positive examples to the training data. We achieve equal or superior performance to previously presented cluster kernel methods and at the same time achieving far greater computational efficiency.

abstract = {In distributed learning, the goal is to perform a learning task over data distributed across multiple nodes with minimal (expensive) communication. Prior work (Daume III et al., 2012) proposes a general model that bounds the communication required for learning classifiers while allowing for {\$}\backslasheps{\$} training error on linearly separable data adversarially distributed across nodes. In this work, we develop key improvements and extensions to this basic model. Our first result is a two-party multiplicative-weight-update based protocol that uses {\$}O(d{\^{}}2 \backslashlog{\{}1/\backslasheps{\}}){\$} words of communication to classify distributed data in arbitrary dimension {\$}d{\$}, {\$}\backslasheps{\$}-optimally. This readily extends to classification over {\$}k{\$} nodes with {\$}O(kd{\^{}}2 \backslashlog{\{}1/\backslasheps{\}}){\$} words of communication. Our proposed protocol is simple to implement and is considerably more efficient than baselines compared, as demonstrated by our empirical results. In addition, we illustrate general algorithm design paradigms for doing efficient learning over distributed data. We show how to solve fixed-dimensional and high dimensional linear programming efficiently in a distributed setting where constraints may be distributed across nodes. Since many learning problems can be viewed as convex optimization problems where constraints are generated by individual points, this models many typical distributed learning scenarios. Our techniques make use of a novel connection from multipass streaming, as well as adapting the multiplicative-weight-update framework more generally to a distributed setting. As a consequence, our methods extend to the wide range of problems solvable using these techniques.},

abstract = {While the harmonic function solution performs well in many semi-supervised learning (SSL) tasks, it is known to scale poorly with the number of samples. Recent successful and scalable methods, such as the eigenfunction method focus on efficiently approximating the whole spectrum of the graph Laplacian constructed from the data. This is in contrast to various subsampling and quantization methods proposed in the past, which may fail in preserving the graph spectra. However, the impact of the approximation of the spectrum on the final generalization error is either unknown, or requires strong assumptions on the data. In this paper, we introduce Sparse-HFS, an efficient edge-sparsification algorithm for SSL. By constructing an edge-sparse and spectrally similar graph, we are able to leverage the approximation guarantees of spectral sparsification methods to bound the generalization error of Sparse-HFS. As a result, we obtain a theoretically-grounded approximation scheme for graph-based SSL that also empirically matches the performance of known large-scale methods.},

abstract = {Automated data-driven decision systems are ubiquitous across a wide variety of online services, from online social networking and e-commerce to e-government. These systems rely on complex learning methods and vast amounts of data to optimize the service functionality, satisfaction of the end user and profitability. However, there is a growing concern that these automated decisions can lead to user discrimination, even in the absence of intent. In this paper, we introduce fairness constraints, a mechanism to ensure fairness in a wide variety of classifiers in a principled manner. Fairness prevents a classifier from outputting predictions correlated with certain sensitive attributes in the data. We then instantiate fairness constraints on three well-known classifiers -- logistic regression, hinge loss and support vector machines (SVM) -- and evaluate their performance in a real-world dataset with meaningful sensitive human attributes. Experiments show that fairness constraints allow for an optimal trade-off between accuracy and fairness.},

abstract = {The goal of active learning is to select the most informative examples for manual labeling. Most of the previous studies in active learning have focused on selecting a single unlabeled example in each iteration. This could be ineﬃcient since the classiﬁcation model has to be retrained for every labeled example. In this paper, we present a framework for “batch mode active learning” that applies the Fisher information matrix to select a number of informative examples simultaneously. The key computational challenge is how to eﬃciently identify the subset of unlabeled examples that can result in the largest reduction in the Fisher information. To resolve this challenge, we propose an eﬃcient greedy algorithm that is based on the property of submodular functions. Our empirical studies with ﬁve UCI datasets and one realworld medical image classiﬁcation show that the proposed batch mode active learning algorithm is more eﬀective than the state-ofthe-art algorithms for active learning},

The interesting aspect of this result is that the minimax rate is independent of the smoothness of the kernel and the density of {\$}P{\$} (if it exists).

abstract = {In healthy aging research, typically multiple health outcomes are measured, representing health status. The aim of this paper was to develop a model-based clustering approach to identify homogeneous sibling pairs according to their health status. Model-based clustering approaches will be considered on the basis of linear mixed effect model for the mixture components. Class memberships of siblings within pairs are allowed to be correlated, and within a class the correlation between siblings is modeled using random sibling pair effects. We propose an expectation-maximization algorithm for maximum likelihood estimation. Model performance is evaluated via simulations in terms of estimating the correct parameters, degree of agreement, and the ability to detect the correct number of clusters. The performance of our model is compared with the performance of standard model-based clustering approaches. The methods are used to classify sibling pairs from the Leiden Longevity Study according to their health status. Our results suggest that homogeneous healthy sibling pairs are associated with a longer life span. Software is available for fitting the new models.},

@article{Gardner2015,
abstract = {Machine learning is increasingly used in high impact applications such as prediction of hospital re-admission, cancer screening or bio-medical research applications. As predictions become increasingly accurate, practitioners may be interested in identifying actionable changes to inputs in order to alter their class membership. For example, a doctor might want to know what changes to a patient's status would predict him/her to not be re-admitted to the hospital soon. Szegedy et al. (2013b) demonstrated that identifying such changes can be very hard in image classification tasks. In fact, tiny, imperceptible changes can result in completely different predictions without any change to the true class label of the input. In this paper we ask the question if we can make small but meaningful changes in order to truly alter the class membership of images from a source class to a target class. To this end we propose deep manifold traversal, a method that learns the manifold of natural images and provides an effective mechanism to move images from one area (dominated by the source class) to another (dominated by the target class).The resulting algorithm is surprisingly effective and versatile. It allows unrestricted movements along the image manifold and only requires few images from source and target to identify meaningful changes. We demonstrate that the exact same procedure can be used to change an individual's appearance of age, facial expressions or even recolor black and white images.},

@article{Jain2016,
abstract = {The problem of developing binary classifiers from positive and unlabeled data is often encountered in machine learning. A common requirement in this setting is to approximate posterior probabilities of positive and negative classes for a previously unseen data point. This problem can be decomposed into two steps: (i) the development of accurate predictors that discriminate between positive and unlabeled data, and (ii) the accurate estimation of the prior probabilities of positive and negative examples. In this work we primarily focus on the latter subproblem. We study nonparametric class prior estimation and formulate this problem as an estimation of mixing proportions in two-component mixture models, given a sample from one of the components and another sample from the mixture itself. We show that estimation of mixing proportions is generally ill-defined and propose a canonical form to obtain identifiability while maintaining the flexibility to model any distribution. We use insights from this theory to elucidate the optimization surface of the class priors and propose an algorithm for estimating them. To address the problems of high-dimensional density estimation, we provide practical transformations to low-dimensional spaces that preserve class priors. Finally, we demonstrate the efficacy of our method on univariate and multivariate data.},

abstract = {Middle-aged offspring of nonagenarians, as compared to their spouses (controls), show a favorable lipid metabolism marked by larger LDL particle size in men and lower total triglyceride levels in women. To investigate which specific lipids associate with familial longevity, we explore the plasma lipidome by measuring 128 lipid species using liquid chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry in 1526 offspring of nonagenarians (59 years ± 6.6) and 675 (59 years ± 7.4) controls from the Leiden Longevity Study. In men, no significant differences were observed between offspring and controls. In women, however, 19 lipid species associated with familial longevity. Female offspring showed higher levels of ether phosphocholine (PC) and sphingomyelin (SM) species (3.5-8.7{\%}) and lower levels of phosphoethanolamine PE (38:6) and long-chain triglycerides (TG) (9.4-12.4{\%}). The association with familial longevity of two ether PC and four SM species was independent of total triglyceride levels. In addition, the longevity-associated lipid profile was characterized by a higher ratio of monounsaturated (MUFA) over polyunsaturated (PUFA) lipid species, suggesting that female offspring have a plasma lipidome less prone to oxidative stress. Ether PC and SM species were identified as novel longevity markers in females, independent of total triglycerides levels. Several longevity-associated lipids correlated with a lower risk of hypertension and diabetes in the Leiden Longevity Study cohort. This sex-specific lipid signature marks familial longevity and may suggest a plasma lipidome with a better antioxidant capacity, lower lipid peroxidation and inflammatory precursors, and an efficient beta-oxidation function.},

abstract = {MOTIVATION: Microarray classification typically possesses two striking attributes: (1) classifier design and error estimation are based on remarkably small samples and (2) cross-validation error estimation is employed in the majority of the papers. Thus, it is necessary to have a quantifiable understanding of the behavior of cross-validation in the context of very small samples. RESULTS: An extensive simulation study has been performed comparing cross-validation, resubstitution and bootstrap estimation for three popular classification rules-linear discriminant analysis, 3-nearest-neighbor and decision trees (CART)-using both synthetic and real breast-cancer patient data. Comparison is via the distribution of differences between the estimated and true errors. Various statistics for the deviation distribution have been computed: mean (for estimator bias), variance (for estimator precision), root-mean square error (for composition of bias and variance) and quartile ranges, including outlier behavior. In general, while cross-validation error estimation is much less biased than resubstitution, it displays excessive variance, which makes individual estimates unreliable for small samples. Bootstrap methods provide improved performance relative to variance, but at a high computational cost and often with increased bias (albeit, much less than with resubstitution).},

@article{Nock2009,
abstract = {Bartlett et al. (2006) recently proved that a ground condition for surrogates, classification calibration, ties up their consistent minimization to that of the classification risk, and left as an important problem the algorithmic questions about their minimization. In this paper, we address this problem for a wide set which lies at the intersection of classification calibrated surrogates and those of Murata et al. (2004). This set coincides with those satisfying three common assumptions about surrogates. Equivalent expressions for the members-sometimes well known-follow for convex and concave surrogates, frequently used in the induction of linear separators and decision trees. Most notably, they share remarkable algorithmic features: for each of these two types of classifiers, we give a minimization algorithm provably converging to the minimum of any such surrogate. While seemingly different, we show that these algorithms are offshoots of the same "master" algorithm. This provides a new and broad unified account of different popular algorithms, including additive regression with the squared loss, the logistic loss, and the top-down induction performed in CART, C4.5. Moreover, we show that the induction enjoys the most popular boosting features, regardless of the surrogate. Experiments are provided on 40 readily available domains.},

@article{Patel2015,
abstract = {A grand challenge in machine learning is the development of computational al-gorithms that match or outperform humans in perceptual inference tasks such as visual object and speech recognition. The key factor complicating such tasks is the presence of numerous nuisance variables, for instance, the unknown object position, orientation, and scale in object recognition or the unknown voice pronunciation, pitch, and speed in speech recognition. Recently, a new breed of deep learning algorithms have emerged for high-nuisance inference tasks; they are constructed from many layers of alternating linear and nonlin-ear processing units and are trained using large-scale algorithms and massive amounts of training data. The recent success of deep learning systems is im-pressive — they now routinely yield pattern recognition systems with near-or super-human capabilities — but a fundamental question remains: Why do they work? Intuitions abound, but a coherent framework for understanding, analyzing, and synthesizing deep learning architectures has remained elusive. We answer this question by developing a new probabilistic framework for deep learning based on a Bayesian generative probabilistic model that explicitly cap-tures variation due to nuisance variables. The graphical structure of the model enables it to be learned from data using classical expectation-maximization techniques. Furthermore, by relaxing the generative model to a discriminative one, we can recover two of the current leading deep learning systems, deep convolutional neural networks (DCNs) and random decision forests (RDFs), providing insights into their successes and shortcomings as well as a princi-pled route to their improvement.},

The purpose of this paper is to provide an overview of LCGA and GMM, compare the different techniques of latent growth modeling, discuss current debates and issues, and provide readers with a practical guide for conducting LCGA and GMM using the Mplus software.},

Based on a suitable explicit parameterisation of the unconditional or conditional transformation function, we establish a cascade of increasingly complex transformation models that can be estimated, compared and analysed in the maximum likelihood framework. Models for the unconditional or conditional distribution function of any univariate response variable can be set-up and estimated in the same theoretical and computational framework simply by choosing an appropriate transformation function and parameterisation thereof. The ability to evaluate the distribution function directly allows us to estimate models based on the exact full likelihood, especially in the presence of random censoring or truncation. For discrete and continuous responses, we establish the asymptotic normality of the proposed estimators. A reference software implementation of maximum likelihood-based estimation for conditional transformation models allowing the same flexibility as the theory developed here was employed to illustrate the wide range of possible applications.},

Our conjecture is that labels correspond to characteristics of natural data which are most salient to humans: identity in faces, objects in images, and utterances in speech. We propose to take advantage of this by using the representations from discriminative classifiers to augment the objective function corresponding to a generative model. In particular we enhance the objective function of the variational autoencoder, a popular generative model, with a discriminative regularization term. We show that enhancing the objective function in this way leads to samples that are clearer and have higher visual quality than the samples from the standard variational autoencoders.},

abstract = {Deep residual networks have emerged as a family of extremely deep architectures showing compelling accuracy and nice convergence behaviors. In this paper, we analyze the propagation formulations behind the residual building blocks, which suggest that the forward and backward signals can be directly propagated from one block to any other block, when using identity mappings as the skip connections and after-addition activation. A series of ablation experiments support the importance of these identity mappings. This motivates us to propose a new residual unit, which further makes training easy and improves generalization. We report improved results using a 1001-layer ResNet on CIFAR-10/100, and a 200-layer ResNet on ImageNet.},

abstract = {Factor analysis, principal component analysis, mixtures of gaussian clusters, vector quantization, Kalman filter models, and hidden Markov models can all be unified as variations of unsupervised learning under a single basic generative model. This is achieved by collecting together disparate observations and derivations made by many previous authors and introducing a new way of linking discrete and continuous state models using a simple nonlinearity. Through the use of other nonlinearities, we show how independent component analysis is also a variation of the same basic generative model. We show that factor analysis and mixtures of gaussians can be implemented in autoencoder neural networks and learned using squared error plus the same regularization term. We introduce a new model for static data, known as sensible principal component analysis, as well as a novel concept of spatially adaptive observation noise. We also review some of the literature involving global and local mixtures of the basic models and provide pseudocode for inference and learning for all the basic models.},

The problem envisaged concerns the case where: (1) the independent variables are considered as fixed numbers; (2) each observation contains the values of the dependent variable and at least one of the independent variables; (3) some observations are complete. In contrast with other approaches dealing with similar problems, the technique developed in this article has the following advantages: (1) it is based on rather unrestrictive hypotheses; (2) the resulting estimators are consistent; (3) the asymptotic variances of these estimators are smaller than those of comparable estimators described in the literature. Although the question is not examined in the present article, it seems also that the proposed method offers good possibilities of generalization.},

abstract = {Hamiltonian dynamics can be used to produce distant proposals for the Metropolis algorithm, thereby avoiding the slow exploration of the state space that results from the diffusive behaviour of simple random-walk proposals. Though originating in physics, Hamiltonian dynamics can be applied to most problems with continuous state spaces by simply introducing fictitious "momentum" variables. A key to its usefulness is that Hamiltonian dynamics preserves volume, and its trajectories can thus be used to define complex mappings without the need to account for a hard to compute Jacobian factor - a property that can be exactly maintained even when the dynamics is approximated by discretizing time. In this review, discuss theoretical and practical aspects of Hamiltonian Monte Carlo, and present some of its variations, including using windows of states for approximations, tempering during the course of a trajectory to handle isolated modes, and short-cut methods that prevent useless trajectories form taking much computation time.},

We prove that the new criterion is an asymptotically unbiased estimator of the expected Kullback-Leibler divergence between the true distribution and the estimated distribution for complete data, whereas AIC is that for the incomplete data. Information criteria PDIO (Shimodaira 1994) and AICcd (Cavanaugh and Shumway 1998) have been previously proposed for the same purpose. Recently, an error is found in the derivation of PDIO, and the new information criterion is obtained by correcting the error. The additional penalty for missing data turns out to be only the half of what is claimed in PDIO. Geometrical view of alternating minimizations of the EM algorithm plays an important role for the derivation.},

Our new method is applied to seek more reliable positive and negative examples from the unlabeled dataset step by step, and the Universum support vector machine(U-SVM) is used iteratively. Different Universum data will result in different performance, so several effective approaches are explored to construct Universum datasets.

abstract = {Modern detection systems use sensor outputs available in the deployment environment to probabilistically identify attacks. These systems are trained on past or synthetic feature vectors to create a model of anomalous or normal behavior. Thereafter, run-time collected sensor outputs are compared to the model to identify attacks (or the lack of attack). While this approach to detection has been proven to be effective in many environments, it is limited to training on only features that can be reliably collected at test-time. Hence, they fail to leverage the often vast amount of ancillary information available from past forensic analysis and post-mortem data. In short, detection systems don't train (and thus don't learn from) features that are unavailable or too costly to collect at run-time. In this paper, we leverage recent advances in machine learning to integrate privileged information --features available at training time, but not at run-time-- into detection algorithms. We apply three different approaches to model training with privileged information; knowledge transfer, model influence, and distillation, and empirically validate their performance in a range of detection domains. Our evaluation shows that privileged information can increase detector precision and recall: we observe an average of 4.8{\%} decrease in detection error for malware traffic detection over a system with no privileged information, 3.53{\%} for fast-flux domain bot detection, 3.33{\%} for malware classification, 11.2{\%} for facial user authentication. We conclude by exploring the limitations and applications of different privileged information techniques in detection systems.},

The pinball loss has been deeply studied and widely applied in regression but it has not been used for classification. In this paper, we propose a SVM classifier with the pinball loss, called pin-SVM, and investigate its properties, including noise insensitivity, robustness, and misclassification error. Besides, insensitive zone is applied to the pin-SVM and a sparse model is obtained. Compared to the SVM with the hinge loss, the proposed pin-SVM has the same computational complexity and enjoys noise insensitivity and re-sampling stability.},

In this paper we revisit archetypal analysis from the basic principles, and propose a probabilistic framework that accommodates other observation types such as integers, binary, and probability vectors. We corroborate the proposed methodology with convincing real-world applications on finding archetypal winter tourists based on binary survey data, archetypal disaster-affected countries based on disaster count data, and document archetypes based on term-frequency data. We also present an appropriate visualization tool to summarize archetypal analysis solution better.},

abstract = {Predictive inference uses a model to analyze a dataset and make predictions about new observations. When a model does not match the data, predictive accuracy suffers. To mitigate this effect, we develop the profile predictive, a predictive density that incorporates the population distribution of data into Bayesian inference. This leads to a practical method for reducing the effect of model mismatch. We extend this method into variational inference and propose a stochastic optimization algorithm, called bumping variational inference. We demonstrate improved predictive accuracy over classical variational inference in two models: a Bayesian mixture model of image histograms and a latent Dirichlet allocation topic model of a text corpus.},

abstract = {Given a weighted graph with {\$}N{\$} vertices, consider a real-valued regression problem in a semi-supervised setting, where one observes {\$}n{\$} labeled vertices, and the task is to label the remaining ones. We present a theoretical study of {\$}\backslashell{\_}p{\$}-based Laplacian regularization under a {\$}d{\$}-dimensional geometric random graph model. We provide a variational characterization of the performance of this regularized learner as {\$}N{\$} grows to infinity while {\$}n{\$} stays constant, the associated optimality conditions lead to a partial differential equation that must be satisfied by the associated function estimate {\$}\backslashhat{\{}f{\}}{\$}. From this formulation we derive several predictions on the limiting behavior the {\$}d{\$}-dimensional function {\$}\backslashhat{\{}f{\}}{\$}, including (a) a phase transition in its smoothness at the threshold {\$}p = d + 1{\$}, and (b) a tradeoff between smoothness and sensitivity to the underlying unlabeled data distribution {\$}P{\$}. Thus, over the range {\$}p \backslashleq d{\$}, the function estimate {\$}\backslashhat{\{}f{\}}{\$} is degenerate and "spiky," whereas for {\$}p\backslashgeq d+1{\$}, the function estimate {\$}\backslashhat{\{}f{\}}{\$} is smooth. We show that the effect of the underlying density vanishes monotonically with {\$}p{\$}, such that in the limit {\$}p = \backslashinfty{\$}, corresponding to the so-called Absolutely Minimal Lipschitz Extension, the estimate {\$}\backslashhat{\{}f{\}}{\$} is independent of the distribution {\$}P{\$}. Under the assumption of semi-supervised smoothness, ignoring {\$}P{\$} can lead to poor statistical performance, in particular, we construct a specific example for {\$}d=1{\$} to demonstrate that {\$}p=2{\$} has lower risk than {\$}p=\backslashinfty{\$} due to the former penalty adapting to {\$}P{\$} and the latter ignoring it. We also provide simulations that verify the accuracy of our predictions for finite sample sizes. Together, these properties show that {\$}p = d+1{\$} is an optimal choice, yielding a function estimate {\$}\backslashhat{\{}f{\}}{\$} that is both smooth and non-degenerate, while remaining maximally sensitive to {\$}P{\$}.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Technological developments have increased the feasibility of large scale genetic association studies. Densely typed genetic markers are obtained using SNP arrays, next-generation sequencing technologies and imputation. However, SNPs typed using these methods can be highly correlated due to linkage disequilibrium among them, and standard multiple regression techniques fail with these data sets due to their high dimensionality and correlation structure. There has been increasing interest in using penalised regression in the analysis of high dimensional data. Ridge regression is one such penalised regression technique which does not perform variable selection, instead estimating a regression coefficient for each predictor variable. It is therefore desirable to obtain an estimate of the significance of each ridge regression coefficient.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: We develop and evaluate a test of significance for ridge regression coefficients. Using simulation studies, we demonstrate that the performance of the test is comparable to that of a permutation test, with the advantage of a much-reduced computational cost. We introduce the p-value trace, a plot of the negative logarithm of the p-values of ridge regression coefficients with increasing shrinkage parameter, which enables the visualisation of the change in p-value of the regression coefficients with increasing penalisation. We apply the proposed method to a lung cancer case-control data set from EPIC, the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: The proposed test is a useful alternative to a permutation test for the estimation of the significance of ridge regression coefficients, at a much-reduced computational cost. The p-value trace is an informative graphical tool for evaluating the results of a test of significance of ridge regression coefficients as the shrinkage parameter increases, and the proposed test makes its production computationally feasible.},

@article{Hanselmann2013,
abstract = {Digital staining for the automated annotation of mass spectrometry imaging (MSI) data has previously been achieved using state-of-the-art classifiers such as random forests or support vector machines (SVMs). However, the training of such classifiers requires an expert to label exemplary data in advance. This process is time-consuming and hence costly, especially if the tissue is heterogeneous. In theory, it may be sufficient to only label a few highly representative pixels of an MS image, but it is not known a priori which pixels to select. This motivates active learning strategies in which the algorithm itself queries the expert by automatically suggesting promising candidate pixels of an MS image for labeling. Given a suitable querying strategy, the number of required training labels can be significantly reduced while maintaining classification accuracy. In this work, we propose active learning for convenient annotation of MSI data. We generalize a recently proposed active learning method to the multiclass case and combine it with the random forest classifier. Its superior performance over random sampling is demonstrated on secondary ion mass spectrometry data, making it an interesting approach for the classification of MS images.},

Our main result shows that the set of possible one-dimensional spaces v, for which the order of the projected class means is identical, defines a convex region with associated convex Bayes error function g(v). This allows for the minimization of the error function using standard convex optimization algorithms. Our algorithm is then extended to the minimization of the Bayes error in the more general case of heteroscedastic distributions. This is done by means of an appropriate kernel mapping function. This result is further extended to obtain the d-dimensional solution for any given d, by iteratively applying our algorithm to the null space of the (d - 1)-dimensional solution. We also show how this result can be used to improve up on the outcomes provided by existing algorithms, and derive a low-computational cost, linear approximation. Extensive experimental validations are provided to demonstrate the use of these algorithms in classification, data analysis and visualization.},

abstract = {We present a series of new theoretical, algorithmic, and empirical results for domain adaptation and sample bias correction in regression. We prove that the discrepancy is a distance for the squared loss when the hypothesis set is the reproducing kernel Hilbert space induced by a universal kernel such as the Gaussian kernel. We give new pointwise loss guarantees based on the discrepancy of the empirical source and target distributions for the general class of kernel-based regularization algorithms. These bounds have a simpler form than previous results and hold for a broader class of convex loss functions not necessarily differentiable, including Lq losses and the hinge loss. We also give finer bounds based on the discrepancy and a weighted feature discrepancy parameter. We extend the discrepancy minimization adaptation algorithm to the more significant case where kernels are used and show that the problem can be cast as an SDP similar to the one in the feature space. We also show that techniques from smooth optimization can be used to derive an efficient algorithm for solving such SDPs even for very high-dimensional feature spaces and large samples. We have implemented this algorithm and report the results of experiments both with artificial and real-world data sets demonstrating its benefits both for general scenario of adaptation and the more specific scenario of sample bias correction. Our results show that it can scale to large data sets of tens of thousands or more points and demonstrate its performance improvement benefits. ?? 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

Owing to the limited number of microarrays typically used in these studies, serious issues arise with respect to the design, performance and analysis of classifiers based on microarray data. This paper reviews some fundamental issues facing small-sample classification: classification rules, constrained classifiers, error estimation and feature selection. It discusses both unconstrained and constrained classifier design from sample data, and the contributions to classifier error from constrained optimization and lack of optimality owing to design from sample data. The difficulty with estimating classifier error when confined to small samples is addressed, particularly estimating the error from training data. The impact of small samples on the ability to include more than a few variables as classifier features is explained.},

abstract = {Constraint-based causal discovery from limited data is a notoriously difficult challenge due to the many borderline independence test decisions. Several approaches to improve the reliability of the predictions by exploiting redundancy in the independence information have been proposed recently. Though promising, existing approaches can still be greatly improved in terms of accuracy and scalability. We present a novel method that reduces the combinatorial explosion of the search space by using a more coarse-grained representation of causal information, drastically reducing computation time. Additionally, we propose a method to score causal predictions based on their confidence. Crucially, our implementation also allows one to easily combine observational and interventional data and to incorporate various types of available background knowledge. We prove soundness and asymptotic consistency of our method and demonstrate that it can outperform the state-of-the-art on synthetic data, achieving a speedup of several orders of magnitude. We illustrate its practical feasibility by applying it on a challenging protein data set.},

abstract = {Fractional imputation (FI) is a relatively new method of imputation for handling item nonresponse in survey sampling. In FI, several imputed values with their fractional weights are created for each missing item. Each fractional weight represents the conditional probability of the imputed value given the observed data, and the parameters in the conditional probabilities are often computed by an iterative method such as EM algorithm. The underlying model for FI can be fully parametric, semiparametric, or nonparametric, depending on plausibility of assumptions and the data structure. In this paper, we give an overview of FI, introduce key ideas and methods to readers who are new to the FI literature, and highlight some new development. We also provide guidance on practical implementation of FI and valid inferential tools after imputation. We demonstrate the empirical performance of FI with respect to multiple imputation using a pseudo finite population generated from a sample in Monthly Retail Trade Survey in US Census Bureau.},

abstract = {Convex optimization is an essential tool for modern data analysis, as it provides a framework to formulate and solve many problems in machine learning and data mining. However, general convex optimization solvers do not scale well, and scalable solvers are often specialized to only work on a narrow class of problems. Therefore, there is a need for simple, scalable algorithms that can solve many common optimization problems. In this paper, we introduce the $\backslash$emph{\{}network lasso{\}}, a generalization of the group lasso to a network setting that allows for simultaneous clustering and optimization on graphs. We develop an algorithm based on the Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM) to solve this problem in a distributed and scalable manner, which allows for guaranteed global convergence even on large graphs. We also examine a non-convex extension of this approach. We then demonstrate that many types of problems can be expressed in our framework. We focus on three in particular - binary classification, predicting housing prices, and event detection in time series data - comparing the network lasso to baseline approaches and showing that it is both a fast and accurate method of solving large optimization problems.},

abstract = {Written by one of the pre-eminent researchers in the field, this book provides a comprehensive exposition of modern analysis of causation. It shows how causality has grown from a nebulous concept into a mathematical theory with significant applications in the fields of statistics, artificial intelligence, philosophy, cognitive science, and the health and social sciences. Pearl presents a unified account of the probabilistic, manipulative, counterfactual and structural approaches to causation, and devises simple mathematical tools for analyzing the relationships between causal connections, statistical associations, actions and observations. The book will open the way for including causal analysis in the standard curriculum of statistics, artifical intelligence, business, epidemiology, social science and economics. Students in these areas will find natural models, simple identification procedures, and precise mathematical definitions of causal concepts that traditional texts have tended to evade or make unduly complicated. This book will be of interest to professionals and students in a wide variety of fields. Anyone who wishes to elucidate meaningful relationships from data, predict effects of actions and policies, assess explanations of reported events, or form theories of causal understanding and causal speech will find this book stimulating and invaluable.

abstract = {Multiple Kernel Learning, or MKL, extends (kernelized) SVM by attempting to learn not only a classifier/regressor but also the best kernel for the training task, usually from a combination of existing kernel functions. Most MKL methods seek the combined kernel that performs best over every training example, sacrificing performance in some areas to seek a global optimum. Localized kernel learning (LKL) overcomes this limitation by allowing the training algorithm to match a component kernel to the examples that can exploit it best. Several approaches to the localized kernel learning problem have been explored in the last several years. We unify many of these approaches under one simple system and design a new algorithm with improved performance. We also develop enhanced versions of existing algorithms, with an eye on scalability and performance.},

abstract = {In PU learning, a binary classifier is trained from positive (P) and unlabeled (U) data without negative (N) data. Although N data is missing, it sometimes outperforms PN learning (i.e., ordinary supervised learning). Hitherto, neither theoretical nor experimental analysis has been given to explain this phenomenon. In this paper, we theoretically compare PU (and NU) learning against PN learning based on the upper bounds of estimation errors. We find simple conditions when PU and NU learning are likely to outperform PN learning, and we prove that, in terms of the upper bounds, either PU or NU learning (depending on the class-prior probability and the sizes of P and N data) given infinite U data will improve on PN learning. Our theoretical findings well agree with the experimental results on artificial and benchmark data even when the experimental setup does not match the theoretical assumptions exactly.},

abstract = {In this paper, we study the heterogeneous domain adaptation (HDA) problem, in which the data from the source domain and the target domain are represented by heterogeneous features with different dimensions. By introducing two different projection matrices, we first transform the data from two domains into a common subspace such that the similarity between samples across different domains can be measured. We then develop two new feature mapping functions for two domains, which respectively augments the transformed source and target samples with their original features and padding zeros. Existing supervised learning methods (e.g., SVM and SVR) can be readily employed by incorporating our newly proposed augmented feature representations for supervised HDA. As a showcase, we propose a novel method called Heterogeneous Feature Augmentation (HFA) based on SVM. We show that the proposed formulation can be equivalently derived as a standard Multiple Kernel Learning (MKL) problem, which is convex and thus the global solution can be guaranteed. To additionally utilize the unlabeled data in the target domain, we further propose the semi-supervised HFA (SHFA) which can simultaneously learn the target classifier as well as infer the labels of unlabeled target samples. Comprehensive experiments on three different applications clearly demonstrate that our SHFA and HFA outperform the existing HDA methods.},

abstract = {The clinical heterogeneity of Parkinson's disease (PD) may point at the existence of subtypes. Because subtypes likely reflect distinct underlying etiologies, their identification may facilitate future genetic and pharmacotherapeutic studies. Aim of this study was to identify subtypes by a data-driven approach applied to a broad spectrum of motor and nonmotor features of PD. Data of motor and nonmotor PD symptoms were collected in 802 patients in two different European prevalent cohorts. A model-based cluster analysis was conducted on baseline data of 344 patients of a Dutch cohort (PROPARK). Reproducibility of these results was tested in data of the second annual assessment of the same cohort and validated in an independent Spanish cohort (ELEP) of 357 patients. The subtypes were subsequently characterized on clinical and demographic variables. Four similar PD subtypes were identified in two different populations and are largely characterized by differences in the severity of nondopaminergic features and motor complications: Subtype 1 was mildly affected in all domains, Subtype 2 was predominantly characterized by severe motor complications, Subtype 3 was affected mainly on nondopaminergic domains without prominent motor complications, while Subtype 4 was severely affected on all domains. The subtypes had largely similar mean disease durations (nonsignificant differences between three clusters) but showed considerable differences with respect to their association with demographic and clinical variables. In prevalent disease, PD subtypes are largely characterized by the severity of nondopaminergic features and motor complications and likely reflect complex interactions between disease mechanisms, treatment, aging, and gender.},

Although specific domain knowledge can be used to help design representations, learning with generic priors can also be used, and the quest for AI is motivating the design of more powerful representation-learning algorithms implementing such priors. This paper reviews recent work in the area of unsupervised feature learning and deep learning, covering advances in probabilistic models, autoencoders, manifold learning, and deep networks. This motivates longer term unanswered questions about the appropriate objectives for learning good representations, for computing representations (i.e., inference), and the geometrical connections between representation learning, density estimation, and manifold learning.},

abstract = {Just as diagnostic tests are most helpful in light of the clinical presentation, statistical tests are most useful in the context of scientific knowledge. Knowing the specificity and sensitivity of a diagnostic test is necessary, but insufficient: the clinician must also estimate the prior probability of the disease. In the same way, knowing the P value and power, or the confidence interval, for the results of a research study is necessary but insufficient: the reader must estimate the prior probability that the research hypothesis is true. Just as a positive diagnostic test does not mean that a patient has the disease, especially if the clinical picture suggests otherwise, a significant P value does not mean that a research hypothesis is correct, especially if it is inconsistent with current knowledge. Powerful studies are like sensitive tests in that they can be especially useful when the results are negative. Very low P values are like very specific tests; both result in few false-positive results due to chance. This Bayesian approach can clarify much of the confusion surrounding the use and interpretation of statistical tests.},

abstract = {Training object class detectors typically requires a large set of images in which objects are annotated by bounding-boxes. However, manually drawing bounding-boxes is very time consuming. We propose a new scheme for training object detectors which only requires annotators to verify bounding-boxes produced automatically by the learning algorithm. Our scheme iterates between re-training the detector, re-localizing objects in the training images, and human verification. We use the verification signal both to improve re-training and to reduce the search space for re-localisation, which makes these steps different to what is normally done in a weakly supervised setting. Extensive experiments on PASCAL VOC 2007 show that (1) using human verification to update detectors and reduce the search space leads to the rapid production of high-quality bounding-box annotations; (2) our scheme delivers detectors performing almost as good as those trained in a fully supervised setting, without ever drawing any bounding-box; (3) as the verification task is very quick, our scheme substantially reduces total annotation time by a factor 6x-9x.},

@article{Drummond2009,
abstract = {At various machine learning conferences, at various times, there have been discussions arising from the inability to replicate the experimental results published in a paper. There seems to be a wide spread view that we need to do something to address this problem, as it is essential to the advancement of our field. The most compelling argument would seem to be that reproducibility of experimental results is the hallmark of science. Therefore, given that most of us regard machine learning as a scientific discipline, being able to replicate experiments is paramount.  I want to challenge this view by separating the notion of reproducibility, a generally desirable property, from replicability, its poor cousin. I claim there are important differences between the two.  Reproducibility requires changes; replicability avoids them. Although reproducibility is desirable, I contend that the impoverished version, replicability, is one not worth having.},

abstract = {We present methods for dealing with missing variables in the context
  of Gaussian Processes and Support Vector Machines. This solves an
  important problem which has largely been ignored by kernel methods:
  How to systematically deal with incomplete data? Our method can also
  be applied to problems with partially observed labels as well as to
  the transductive setting where we view the labels as missing data.
  
  Our approach relies on casting kernel methods as an estimation
  problem in exponential families. Hence, estimation with missing
  variables becomes a problem of computing marginal distributions, and
  finding efficient optimization methods. To that extent we propose an
  optimization scheme which extends the Concave Convex Procedure (CCP)
  of Yuille and Rangarajan, and present a simplified and intuitive
  proof of its convergence. We show how our algorithm can be
  specialized to various cases in order to efficiently solve the
  optimization problems that arise. Encouraging preliminary
  experimental results on the USPS dataset are also presented.},

VAEs have already shown promise in generating many kinds of complicated data, including handwritten digits, faces, house numbers, CIFAR images, physical models of scenes, segmentation, and predicting the future from static images. This tutorial introduces the intuitions behind VAEs, explains the mathematics behind them, and describes some empirical behavior. No prior knowledge of variational Bayesian methods is assumed.},

It is based on the idea that a stochastic model is adequate if samples generated under the model are very much like the sample actually obtained. The formalization is based on the concept of data feature. Examples are given of applying the ideas to different areas of statistics including location-scale models, densities, non-parametric regression, interlaboratory test, auto-regressive processes and the analysis of variance. The four cornerstones of the approach are direct comparison, approximation, weak topologies and parsimony. The approach is contrasted to that of much of conventional statistics many of whose concepts are pathologically discontinuous with respect to the topology of data analysis and common sense.},

abstract = {How should one statistically analyze privacy-enhanced data? In theory, one could process it exactly as if it were normal data since many differentially private algorithms asymptotically converge exponentially fast to their non-private counterparts and/or have error that asymptotically decreases as fast as sampling error. In practice, convergence often requires enormous amounts of data. Thus making differential privacy practical requires the development of techniques that specifically account for the noise that is added for the sake of providing privacy guarantees. Such techniques are especially needed for statistical hypothesis testing. Previous approaches either ignored the added noise (resulting in highly biased {\$}p{\$}-values), accounted for the noise but had high variance, or accounted for the noise while having small variance but were restricted to very specific types of data sets. In this paper, we propose statistical tests of independence that address all three problems simultaneously -- they add small amounts of noise, account for this noise to produce accurate {\$}p{\$}-values, and have no restrictions on the types of tables to which they are applicable. Along with these tests, we propose an alternative methodology for computing the asymptotic distributions of test statistics that results in better finite-sample approximations when using differential privacy to protect data.},

The advantage of these reformulations is that the replacement terms do not oppose each other. Instead of debating over whether a given statistical method is subjec-tive or objective (or normatively debating the relative merits of subjectivity and objectivity in statistical practice), we can recognize desirable attributes such as transparency and acknowledg-ment of multiple perspectives as complementary goals.

@article{Ben-David2015a,
abstract = {It is well known that most of the common clustering objectives are NP-hard to optimize. In practice, however, clustering is being routinely carried out. One approach for providing theoretical understanding of this seeming discrepancy is to come up with notions of clusterability that distinguish realistically interesting input data from worst-case data sets. The hope is that there will be clustering algorithms that are provably efficient on such "clusterable" instances. This paper addresses the thesis that the computational hardness of clustering tasks goes away for inputs that one really cares about. In other words, that "Clustering is difficult only when it does not matter" (the $\backslash$emph{\{}CDNM thesis{\}} for short). I wish to present a a critical bird's eye overview of the results published on this issue so far and to call attention to the gap between available and desirable results on this issue. A longer, more detailed version of this note is available as arXiv:1507.05307. I discuss which requirements should be met in order to provide formal support to the the CDNM thesis and then examine existing results in view of these requirements and list some significant unsolved research challenges in that direction.},

This procedure can be applied to almost any optimization problem, and many existing algorithms can be interpreted in terms of it. In particular, we prove that all expectation-maximization algorithms and classes of Legendre minimization and variational bounding algorithms can be reexpressed in terms of CCCP. We show that many existing neural network and mean-field theory algorithms are also examples of CCCP. The generalized iterative scaling algorithm and Sinkhorn's algorithm can also be expressed as CCCP by changing variables. CCCP can be used both as a new way to understand, and prove the convergence of, existing optimization algorithms and as a procedure for generating new algorithms.},

@article{Ioannidis2005,
abstract = {There is increasing concern that most current published research findings are false. The probability that a research claim is true may depend on study power and bias, the number of other studies on the same question, and, importantly, the ratio of true to no relationships among the relationships probed in each scientific field. In this framework, a research finding is less likely to be true when the studies conducted in a field are smaller; when effect sizes are smaller; when there is a greater number and lesser preselection of tested relationships; where there is greater flexibility in designs, definitions, outcomes, and analytical modes; when there is greater financial and other interest and prejudice; and when more teams are involved in a scientific field in chase of statistical significance. Simulations show that for most study designs and settings, it is more likely for a research claim to be false than true. Moreover, for many current scientific fields, claimed research findings may often be simply accurate measures of the prevailing bias. In this essay, I discuss the implications of these problems for the conduct and interpretation of research.},

However, automating human expertise remains elusive, for example, Gaussian processes with standard kernels struggle on function extrapolation problems that are trivial for human learners. In this paper, we create function extrapolation problems and acquire human responses, and then design a kernel learning framework to reverse engineer the inductive biases of human learners across a set of behavioral experiments. We use the learned kernels to gain psychological insights and to extrapolate in human-like ways that go beyond traditional stationary and polynomial kernels. Finally, we investigate Occam's razor in human and Gaussian process based function learning.},

abstract = {Modern massive datasets create a fundamental problem at the intersection of the computational and statistical sciences: how to provide guarantees on the quality of statistical inference given bounds on computational resources, such as time or space. Our approach to this problem is to define a notion of "algorithmic weakening," in which a hierarchy of algorithms is ordered by both computational efficiency and statistical efficiency, allowing the growing strength of the data at scale to be traded off against the need for sophisticated processing. We illustrate this approach in the setting of denoising problems, using convex relaxation as the core inferential tool. Hierarchies of convex relaxations have been widely used in theoretical computer science to yield tractable approximation algorithms to many computationally intractable tasks. In the current paper, we show how to endow such hierarchies with a statistical characterization and thereby obtain concrete tradeoffs relating algorithmic runtime to amount of data.},

abstract = {In clinical diagnostics, it is of outmost importance to correctly identify the source of a metastatic tumor, especially if no apparent primary tumor is present. Tissue-based proteomics might allow correct tumor classification. As a result, we performed MALDI imaging to generate proteomic signatures for different tumors. These signatures were used to classify common cancer types. At first, a cohort comprised of tissue samples from six adenocarcinoma entities located at different organ sites (esophagus, breast, colon, liver, stomach, thyroid gland, n = 171) was classified using two algorithms for a training and test set. For the test set, Support Vector Machine and Random Forest yielded overall accuracies of 82.74 and 81.18{\%}, respectively. Then, colon cancer liver metastasis samples (n = 19) were introduced into the classification. The liver metastasis samples could be discriminated with high accuracy from primary tumors of colon cancer and hepatocellular carcinoma. Additionally, colon cancer liver metastasis samples could be successfully classified by using colon cancer primary tumor samples for the training of the classifier. These findings demonstrate that MALDI imaging-derived proteomic classifiers can discriminate between different tumor types at different organ sites and in the same site.},

@article{Reid2015,
abstract = {Applied statistical problems often come with pre-specified groupings to predictors. It is natural to test for the presence of simultaneous group-wide signal for groups in isolation, or for multiple groups together. Classical tests for the presence of such signals rely either on tests for the omission of the entire block of variables (the classical F-test) or on the creation of an unsupervised prototype for the group (either a group centroid or first principal component) and subsequent t-tests on these prototypes. In this paper, we propose test statistics that aim for power improvements over these classical approaches. In particular, we first create group prototypes, with reference to the response, hopefully improving on the unsupervised prototypes, and then testing with likelihood ratio statistics incorporating only these prototypes. We propose a (potentially) novel model, called the "prototype model", which naturally models the two-step prototype-then-test procedure. Furthermore, we introduce an inferential schema detailing the unique considerations for different combinations of prototype formation and univariate/multivariate testing models. The prototype model also suggests new applications to estimation and prediction. Prototype formation often relies on variable selection, which invalidates classical Gaussian test theory. We use recent advances in selective inference to account for selection in the prototyping step and retain test validity. Simulation experiments suggest that our testing procedure enjoys more power than do classical approaches.},

abstract = {We develop stochastic variational inference, a scalable algorithm for approximating posterior distributions. We develop this technique for a large class of probabilistic models and we demonstrate it with two probabilistic topic models, latent Dirichlet allocation and the hierarchical Dirichlet process topic model. Using stochastic variational inference, we analyze several large collections of documents: 300K articles from Nature, 1.8M articles from The New York Times, and 3.8M articles from Wikipedia. Stochastic inference can easily handle data sets of this size and outperforms traditional variational inference, which can only handle a smaller subset. (We also show that the Bayesian nonparametric topic model outperforms its parametric counterpart.) Stochastic variational inference lets us apply complex Bayesian models to massive data sets.},

abstract = {Probability models are only useful at explaining the uncertainty of what we do not know, and should never be used to say what we already know. Probability and statistical models are useless at discerning cause. Classical statistical procedures, in both their frequentist and Bayesian implementations are, falsely imply they can speak about cause. No hypothesis test, or Bayes factor, should ever be used again. Even assuming we know the cause or partial cause for some set of observations, reporting via relative risk exagerates the certainty we have in the future, often by a lot. This over-certainty is made much worse when parametetric and not predictive methods are used. Unfortunately, predictive methods are rarely used; and even when they are, cause must still be an assumption, meaning (again) certainty in our scientific pronouncements is too high.},

LOO and WAIC have various advantages over simpler estimates of predictive error such as AIC and DIC but are less used in practice because they involve additional computational steps. Here we lay out fast and stable computations for LOO and WAIC that can be performed using existing simulation draws. We compute LOO using Pareto smoothed importance sampling (PSIS), a new procedure for regularizing importance weights. As a byproduct of our calculations, we also obtain approximate standard errors for estimated predictive errors and for comparing of predictive errors between two models. We implement the computations in an R package called 'loo' and demonstrate using models fit with the Bayesian inference package Stan.},

abstract = {A number of problems in probability and statistics can be addressed using the multivariate normal (Gaussian) distribution. In the one-dimensional case, computing the probability for a given mean and variance simply requires the evaluation of the corresponding Gaussian density. In the {\$}n{\$} -dimensional setting, however, it requires the inversion of an {\$}n times n{\$} covariance matrix, {\$}C{\$} , as well as the evaluation of its determinant, {\$}det (C){\$} . In many cases, such as regression using Gaussian processes, the covariance matrix is of the form {\$}C = sigma {\^{}}2 I + K{\$} , where {\$}K{\$} is computed using a specified covariance kernel which depends on the data and additional parameters (hyperparameters). The matrix {\$}C{\$} is typically dense, causing standard direct methods for inversion and determinant evaluation to require {\$}mathcal {\{}O{\}}(n{\^{}}3){\$} work. This cost is prohibitive for large-scale modeling. Here, we show that for the most commonly used covariance functions, the matrix {\$}C{\$} can be hierarchically factored into a product of block low-rank updates of the identity matrix, yielding an {\$}mathcal {\{}O{\}} (n,log{\^{}}2, n){\$} algorithm for inversion. More importantly, we show that this factorization enables the evaluation of the determinant {\$}det (C){\$}, permitting the direct calculation of probabilities in high dimensions under fairly broad assumptions on the kernel defining {\$}K{\$} . Our fast algorithm brings many problems in marginalization and the adaptation of hyperparameters within practical reach using a single CPU core. The combination of nearly optimal scaling in terms of problem size with high-performance computing resources will permit the modeling of previously intractable problems. We illustrate the performance of the scheme on standard covariance kernels.},

In this paper, we consider fully connected CRF models defined on the complete set of pixels in an image. The resulting graphs have billions of edges, making traditional inference algorithms impractical. Our main contribution is a highly efficient approximate inference algorithm for fully connected CRF models in which the pairwise edge potentials are defined by a linear combination of Gaussian kernels. Our experiments demonstrate that dense connectivity at the pixel level substantially improves segmentation and labeling accuracy.},

abstract = {Compressive sensing (CS) exploits sparsity to recover sparse or compressible signals from dimensionality reducing, non-adaptive sensing mechanisms. Sparsity is also used to enhance interpretability in machine learning and statistics applications: While the ambient dimension is vast in modern data analysis problems, the relevant information therein typically resides in a much lower dimensional space. However, many solutions proposed nowadays do not leverage the true underlying structure. Recent results in CS extend the simple sparsity idea to more sophisticated {\{}$\backslash$em structured{\}} sparsity models, which describe the interdependency between the nonzero components of a signal, allowing to increase the interpretability of the results and lead to better recovery performance. In order to better understand the impact of structured sparsity, in this chapter we analyze the connections between the discrete models and their convex relaxations, highlighting their relative advantages. We start with the general group sparse model and then elaborate on two important special cases: the dispersive and the hierarchical models. For each, we present the models in their discrete nature, discuss how to solve the ensuing discrete problems and then describe convex relaxations. We also consider more general structures as defined by set functions and present their convex proxies. Further, we discuss efficient optimization solutions for structured sparsity problems and illustrate structured sparsity in action via three applications.},

abstract = {Multiple imputation is a common approach for dealing with missing values in statistical databases. The imputer fills in missing values with draws from predictive models estimated from the observed data, resulting in multiple, completed versions of the database. Researchers have developed a variety of default routines to implement multiple imputation; however, there has been limited research comparing the performance of these methods, particularly for categorical data. We use simulation studies to compare repeated sampling properties of three default multiple imputation methods for categorical data, including chained equations using generalized linear models, chained equations using classification and regression trees, and a fully Bayesian joint distribution based on Dirichlet Process mixture models. We base the simulations on categorical data from the American Community Survey. The results suggest that default chained equations approaches based on generalized linear models are dominated by the default regression tree and mixture model approaches. They also suggest competing advantages for the regression tree and mixture model approaches, making both reasonable default engines for multiple imputation of categorical data.},

abstract = {Developing theoretical foundations for learning is a key step towards understanding intelligence. 'Learning from examples' is a paradigm in which systems (natural or artificial) learn a functional relationship from a training set of examples. Within this paradigm, a learning algorithm is a map from the space of training sets to the hypothesis space of possible functional solutions. A central question for the theory is to determine conditions under which a learning algorithm will generalize from its finite training set to novel examples. A milestone in learning theory was a characterization of conditions on the hypothesis space that ensure generalization for the natural class of empirical risk minimization (ERM) learning algorithms that are based on minimizing the error on the training set. Here we provide conditions for generalization in terms of a precise stability property of the learning process: when the training set is perturbed by deleting one example, the learned hypothesis does not change much. This stability property stipulates conditions on the learning map rather than on the hypothesis space, subsumes the classical theory for ERM algorithms, and is applicable to more general algorithms. The surprising connection between stability and predictivity has implications for the foundations of learning theory and for the design of novel algorithms, and provides insights into problems as diverse as language learning and inverse problems in physics and engineering.},

abstract = {Imaging mass spectrometry (IMS) is a promising technology which allows for detailed analysis of spatial distributions of (bio)molecules in organic samples. In many current applications, IMS relies heavily on (semi)automated exploratory data analysis procedures to decompose the data into characteristic component spectra and corresponding abundance maps, visualizing spectral and spatial structure. The most commonly used techniques are principal component analysis (PCA) and independent component analysis (ICA). Both methods operate in an unsupervised manner. However, their decomposition estimates usually feature negative counts and are not amenable to direct physical interpretation. We propose probabilistic latent semantic analysis (pLSA) for non-negative decomposition and the elucidation of interpretable component spectra and abundance maps. We compare this algorithm to PCA, ICA, and non-negative PARAFAC (parallel factors analysis) and show on simulated and real-world data that pLSA and non-negative PARAFAC are superior to PCA or ICA in terms of complementarity of the resulting components and reconstruction accuracy. We further combine pLSA decomposition with a statistical complexity estimation scheme based on the Akaike information criterion (AIC) to automatically estimate the number of components present in a tissue sample data set and show that this results in sensible complexity estimates.},

While research efforts have raised hopes of early and less invasive diagnosis, they have also brought to light the many issues to be tackled before mass-spectra-based proteomic patterns become routine clinical tools. Known issues cover the entire pipeline leading from sample collection through mass spectrometry analytics to biomarker pattern extraction, validation, and interpretation. This study focuses on the data-analytical phase, which takes as input mass spectra of biological specimens and discovers patterns of peak masses and intensities that discriminate between different pathological states. We survey current work and investigate computational issues concerning the different stages of the knowledge discovery process: exploratory analysis, quality control, and diverse transforms of mass spectra, followed by further dimensionality reduction, classification, and model evaluation. We conclude after a brief discussion of the critical biomedical task of analyzing discovered discriminatory patterns to identify their component proteins as well as interpret and validate their biological implications.},

abstract = {The accuracy of published medical research is critical for scientists, physicians and patients who rely on these results. However, the fundamental belief in the medical literature was called into serious question by a paper suggesting that most published medical research is false. Here we adapt estimation methods from the genomics community to the problem of estimating the rate of false discoveries in the medical literature using reported {\$}P{\$}-values as the data. We then collect {\$}P{\$}-values from the abstracts of all 77 430 papers published in The Lancet, The Journal of the American Medical Association, The New England Journal of Medicine, The British Medical Journal, and The American Journal of Epidemiology between 2000 and 2010. Among these papers, we found 5322 reported {\$}P{\$}-values. We estimate that the overall rate of false discoveries among reported results is 14{\%} (s.d. 1{\%}), contrary to previous claims. We also found that there is no a significant increase in the estimated rate of reported false discovery results over time (0.5{\%} more false positives (FP) per year, {\$}P = 0.18{\$}) or with respect to journal submissions (0.5{\%} more FP per 100 submissions, {\$}P = 0.12{\$}). Statistical analysis must allow for false discoveries in order to make claims on the basis of noisy data. But our analysis suggests that the medical literature remains a reliable record of scientific progress.},

In this view, the difference between mean-field methods and belief propagation is not the amount of structure they model, but only the measure of loss they minimize (`exclusive' versus `inclusive' Kullback-Leibler divergence). In each case, message-passing arises by minimizing a localized version of the divergence, local to each factor. By examining these divergence measures, we can intuit the types of solution they prefer (symmetry-breaking, for example) and their suitability for different tasks. Furthermore, by considering a wider variety of divergence measures (such as alpha-divergences), we can achieve different complexity and performance goals.},

abstract = {Mass Spectrometric Imaging (MSI) is a molecular imaging technique that allows the generation of 2D ion density maps for a large complement of the active molecules present in cells and sectioned tissues. Automatic segmentation of such maps according to patterns of co-expression of individual molecules can be used for discovery of novel molecular signatures (molecules that are specifically expressed in particular spatial regions). However, current segmentation techniques are biased toward the discovery of higher abundance molecules and large segments; they allow limited opportunity for user interaction, and validation is usually performed by similarity to known anatomical features. We describe here a novel method, AMASS (Algorithm for MSI Analysis by Semi-supervised Segmentation). AMASS relies on the discriminating power of a molecular signal instead of its intensity as a key feature, uses an internal consistency measure for validation, and allows significant user interaction and supervision as options. An automated segmentation of entire leech embryo data images resulted in segmentation domains congruent with many known organs, including heart, CNS ganglia, nephridia, nephridiopores, and lateral and ventral regions, each with a distinct molecular signature. Likewise, segmentation of a rat brain MSI slice data set yielded known brain features and provided interesting examples of co-expression between distinct brain regions. AMASS represents a new approach for the discovery of peptide masses with distinct spatial features of expression. Software source code and installation and usage guide are available at http://bix.ucsd.edu/AMASS/ .},

abstract = {The discovery of causal relationships from purely observational data is a fundamental problem in science. The most elementary form of such a causal discovery problem is to decide whether X causes Y or, alternatively, Y causes X, given joint observations of two variables X,Y. An example is to decide whether altitude causes temperature, or vice versa, given only joint measurements of both variables. Even under the simplifying assumptions of causal sufficiency, no feedback loops, and no selection bias, such bivariate causal discovery problems are very challenging. Nevertheless, several approaches for addressing those problems have been proposed in recent years. We review two families of such methods: Additive Noise Methods (ANM) and Information Geometric Causal Inference (IGCI). We present the benchmark CauseEffectPairs that consists of data for 96 different cause-effect pairs selected from 34 datasets from various domains (e.g., meteorology, biology, medicine, engineering, economy, etc.). We motivate our decisions regarding the "ground truth" causal directions of all pairs. We evaluate the performance of several bivariate causal discovery methods on these real-world benchmark data and in addition on artificially simulated data. Our empirical results indicate that certain methods are able to distinguish cause from effect using only purely observational data with an accuracy of 63-69{\%}. Because of multiple-testing corrections, however, considerably more benchmark data would be needed to obtain statistically significant conclusions. A theoretical contribution of this paper is a proof of the consistency of the additive-noise method as originally proposed by Hoyer et al. (2009).},

abstract = {One of the core problems of modern statistics is to approximate difficult-to-compute probability distributions. This problem is especially important in Bayesian statistics, which frames all inference about unknown quantities as a calculation about the posterior. In this paper, we review variational inference (VI), a method from machine learning that approximates probability distributions through optimization. VI has been used in myriad applications and tends to be faster than classical methods, such as Markov chain Monte Carlo sampling. The idea behind VI is to first posit a family of distributions and then to find the member of that family which is close to the target. Closeness is measured by Kullback-Leibler divergence. We review the ideas behind mean-field variational inference, discuss the special case of VI applied to exponential family models, present a full example with a Bayesian mixture of Gaussians, and derive a variant that uses stochastic optimization to scale up to massive data. We discuss modern research in VI and highlight important open problems. VI is powerful, but it is not yet well understood. Our hope in writing this paper is to catalyze statistical research on this widely-used class of algorithms.},

abstract = {In this paper we present a method for learning a discriminative classifier from unlabeled or partially labeled data. Our approach is based on an objective function that trades-off mutual information between observed examples and their predicted categorical class distribution, against robustness of the classifier to an adversarial generative model. The resulting algorithm can either be interpreted as a natural generalization of the generative adversarial networks (GAN) framework or as an extension of the regularized information maximization (RIM) framework to robust classification against an optimal adversary. We empirically evaluate our method - which we dub categorical generative adversarial networks (or CatGAN) - on synthetic data as well as on challenging image classification tasks, demonstrating the robustness of the learned classifiers. We further qualitatively assess the fidelity of samples generated by the adversarial generator that is learned alongside the discriminative classifier, and identify links between the CatGAN objective and discriminative clustering algorithms (such as RIM).},

abstract = {We demonstrate the usefulness of submodularity in statistics. Greedy algorithms such as forward stepwise regression and the lasso perform well in situations that can be characterized by submodularity. In particular, submodularity of the coefficient of determination, R{\$}{\^{}}2{\$}, provides a natural way to analyze the effects of collinearity on model selection. In model selection, we encounter the search problem of identifying a subset of k covariates with predictive loss close to that of the best model of k covariates. Submodularity arises naturally in this setting due to its deep roots within combinatorial optimization. It provides structural results for discrete convexity as well as guarantees for the success of greedy algorithms. In statistics, submodularity isolates cases in which collinearity makes the choice of model features difficult from those in which this task is routine. Submodularity of R{\$}{\^{}}2{\$} is closely related to other statistical assumptions used in variable screening and proving the performance of the Lasso. This has important implications for the use of model selection procedures: the situations in which forward stepwise and Lasso are successful are closely related.},

abstract = {The clinical variability between patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) may point at the existence of subtypes of the disease. Identification of subtypes is important, since a focus on homogeneous groups may enhance the chance of success of research on mechanisms of disease and may also lead to tailored treatment strategies. Cluster analysis (CA) is an objective method to classify patients into subtypes. We systematically reviewed the methodology and results of CA studies in PD to gain a better understanding of the robustness of identified subtypes. We found seven studies that fulfilled the inclusion criteria. Studies were limited by incomplete reporting and methodological limitations. Differences between studies rendered comparisons of the results difficult. However, it appeared that studies which applied a comparable design identified similar subtypes. The cluster profiles "old age-at-onset and rapid disease progression" and "young age-at-onset and slow disease progression" emerged from the majority of studies. Other cluster profiles were less consistent across studies. Future studies with a rigorous study design that is standardized with respect to the included variables, data processing, and CA technique may advance the knowledge on subtypes in PD.},

We show that most of these conditions are special cases of a single, unifying condition, that comes in two forms: the central condition for 'proper' learning algorithms that always output a hypothesis in the given model, and stochastic mixability for online algorithms that may make predictions outside of the model. We show that, under surprisingly weak conditions, both conditions are, in a certain sense, equivalent. The central condition has a re-interpretation in terms of convexity of a set of pseudoprobabilities, linking it to density estimation under misspecification. For bounded losses, we show how the central condition enables a direct proof of fast rates and we prove its equivalence to the Bernstein condition, itself a generalization of the Tsybakov-Mammen margin condition, which has played a central role in obtaining fast rates in statistical learning. Yet, while the Bernstein condition is two-sided, the central condition is one-sided, making it more suitable to deal with unbounded losses. In its stochastic mixability form, our condition generalizes both a stochastic exp-concavity condition identified by Juditsky, Rigollet and Tsybakov, and Vovk's notion of mixability. Our unifying conditions thus provide a significant step towards a characterization of fast rates in statistical learning, similar to how classical mixability characterizes constant regret in the sequential prediction with expert advice setting.},

abstract = {Transductive learning considers a training set of {\$}m{\$} labeled samples and a test set of {\$}u{\$} unlabeled samples, with the goal of best labeling that particular test set. Conversely, inductive learning considers a training set of {\$}m{\$} labeled samples drawn iid from {\$}P(X,Y){\$}, with the goal of best labeling any future samples drawn iid from {\$}P(X){\$}. This comparison suggests that transduction is a much easier type of inference than induction, but is this really the case? This paper provides a negative answer to this question, by proving the first known minimax lower bounds for transductive, realizable, binary classification. Our lower bounds show that {\$}m{\$} should be at least {\$}\backslashOmega(d/\backslashepsilon + \backslashlog(1/\backslashdelta)/\backslashepsilon){\$} when {\$}\backslashepsilon{\$}-learning a concept class {\$}\backslashmathcal{\{}H{\}}{\$} of finite VC-dimension {\$}d{\textless}\backslashinfty{\$} with confidence {\$}1-\backslashdelta{\$}, for all {\$}m \backslashleq u{\$}. This result draws three important conclusions. First, general transduction is as hard as general induction, since both problems have {\$}\backslashOmega(d/m){\$} minimax values. Second, the use of unlabeled data does not help general transduction, since supervised learning algorithms such as ERM and (Hanneke, 2015) match our transductive lower bounds while ignoring the unlabeled test set. Third, our transductive lower bounds imply lower bounds for semi-supervised learning, which add to the important discussion about the role of unlabeled data in machine learning.},

Our formulation encompasses both Vector-valued Manifold Regularization and Co-regularized Multi-view Learning, providing in particular a unifying framework linking these two important learning approaches. In the case of the least square loss function, we provide a closed form solution, which is obtained by solving a system of linear equations. In the case of Support Vector Machine (SVM) classification, our formulation generalizes in particular both the binary Laplacian SVM to the multi-class, multi-view settings and the multi-class Simplex Cone SVM to the semi-supervised, multi-view settings. The solution is obtained by solving a single quadratic optimization problem, as in standard SVM, via the Sequential Minimal Optimization (SMO) approach. Empirical results obtained on the task of object recognition, using several challenging datasets, demonstrate the competitiveness of our algorithms compared with other state-of-the-art methods.},

abstract = {Author name disambiguation in bibliographic databases is the problem of grouping together scientific publications written by the same person, accounting for potential homonyms and/or synonyms. Among solutions to this problem, digital libraries are increasingly offering tools for authors to manually curate their publications and claim those that are theirs. Indirectly, these tools allow for the inexpensive collection of large annotated training data, which can be further leveraged to build a complementary automated disambiguation system capable of inferring patterns for identifying publications written by the same person. Building on more than 1 million publicly released crowdsourced annotations, we propose an automated author disambiguation solution exploiting this data (i) to learn an accurate classifier for identifying coreferring authors and (ii) to guide the clustering of scientific publications by distinct authors in a semi-supervised way. To the best of our knowledge, our analysis is the first to be carried out on data of this size and coverage. With respect to the state of the art, we validate the general pipeline used in most existing solutions, and improve by: (i) proposing phonetic-based blocking strategies, thereby increasing recall; and (ii) adding strong ethnicity-sensitive features for learning a linkage function, thereby tailoring disambiguation to non-Western author names whenever necessary.},

We construct the variational Gaussian process (VGP), a Bayesian nonparametric model which adapts its shape to match complex posterior distributions. The VGP generates approximate posterior samples by generating latent inputs and warping them through random non-linear mappings; the distribution over random mappings is learned during inference, enabling the transformed outputs to adapt to varying complexity. We prove a universal approximation theorem for the VGP, demonstrating its representative power for learning any model. For inference we present a variational objective inspired by autoencoders and perform black box inference over a wide class of models. The VGP achieves new state-of-the-art results for unsupervised learning, inferring models such as the deep latent Gaussian model and the recently proposed DRAW.},

We define the {\{}$\backslash$it resampling effectiveness{\}} of random CV estimators of the generalization error as the ratio of the limiting value of the variance of the CV estimator over the estimated from the data variance. The variance and the covariance of different average test set errors are independent of their indices, thus, the resampling effectiveness depends on the correlation and the number of repetitions used in the random CV estimator. We discuss statistical rules to define optimality and obtain the "optimal" training sample size as the solution of an appropriately formulated optimization problem. We show that in a broad class of loss functions the optimal training size equals half of the total sample size, independently of the data distribution. We optimally select the number of folds in {\$}k{\$}-fold cross validation and offer a computational procedure for obtaining the optimal splitting in the case of classification (via logistic regression). We substantiate our claims both, theoretically and empirically.},

abstract = {From training data from several related domains (or tasks), methods of domain adaptation try to combine knowledge to improve performance. This paper discusses an approach to domain adaptation which is inspired by a causal interpretation of the multi-task problem. We assume that a covariate shift assumption holds true for a subset of predictor variables: the conditional of the target variable given this subset of predictors is invariant with respect to shifts in those predictors (covariates). We propose to learn the corresponding conditional expectation in the training domains and use it for estimation in the target domain. We further introduce a method which allows for automatic inference of the above subset in regression and classification. We study the performance of this approach in an adversarial setting, in the case where no additional examples are available in the test domain. If a labeled sample is available, we provide a method for using both the transferred invariant conditional and task specific information. We present results on synthetic data sets and a sentiment analysis problem.},

@article{VanderKooi2013,
abstract = {OBJECTIVES: We investigated how much the Human Development Index (HDI), a global measure of development, modifies the effect of education on self-reported health.

METHODS: We analyzed cross-sectional World Health Survey data on 217,642 individuals from 49 countries, collected in 2002 to 2005, with random-intercept multilevel linear regression models.

RESULTS: We observed greater positive associations between educational levels and self-reported good health with increasing HDI. The magnitude of this effect modification of the education-health relation tended to increase with educational attainment. For example, before adjustment for effect modification, at comparable HDI, on average, finishing primary school was associated with better general health (b = 1.49; 95{\%} confidence interval [CI] = 1.18, 1.80). With adjustment for effect modification by HDI, the impact became 4.63 (95{\%} CI = 3.63, 5.62) for every 0.1 increase in HDI. Among those who completed high school, these associations were, respectively, 5.59 (95{\%} CI = 5.20, 5.98) and 9.95 (95{\%} CI = 8.89, 11.00).

CONCLUSIONS: The health benefits of educational attainment are greater in countries with greater human development. Health inequalities attributable to education are, therefore, larger in more developed countries.},

It is known that batch effects can alter or obscure the set of significant results and biological conclusions in high-throughput studies. Here we examine the impact of batch effects on predictors built from genomic technologies. To investigate batch effects, we collected publicly available gene expression measurements with known outcomes, and estimated batches using date. Using these data we show (1) the impact of batch effects on prediction depends on the correlation between outcome and batch in the training data, and (2) removing expression measurements most affected by batch before building predictors may improve the accuracy of those predictors. These results suggest that (1) training sets should be designed to minimize correlation between batches and outcome, and (2) methods for identifying batch-affected probes should be developed to improve prediction results for studies with high correlation between batches and outcome.},

Estimating an HMM from its observation process is often addressed via the Baum-Welch algorithm, which is known to be susceptible to local optima. In this paper, we first give a general characterization of the basin of attraction associated with any global optimum of the population likelihood. By exploiting this characterization, we provide non-asymptotic finite sample guarantees on the Baum-Welch updates, guaranteeing geometric convergence to a small ball of radius on the order of the minimax rate around a global optimum. As a concrete example, we prove a linear rate of convergence for a hidden Markov mixture of two isotropic Gaussians given a suitable mean separation and an initialization within a ball of large radius around (one of) the true parameters. To our knowledge, these are the first rigorous local convergence guarantees to global optima for the Baum-Welch algorithm in a setting where the likelihood function is nonconvex. We complement our theoretical results with thorough numerical simulations studying the convergence of the Baum-Welch algorithm and illustrating the accuracy of our predictions.},

In particular, they show that when misclassification is present, covariate control can sometimes increase net bias, even when the covariate would have been a confounder under perfect classification, and even if the covariate is a determinant of classification. Thus, bias due to misclassification cannot be adequately dealt with by the methods used for control of confounding. The examples presented also show that the "change-in-estimate" criterion for deciding whether to control a covariate can be systematically misleading when misclassification is present. These results demonstrate that it is necessary to consider the degree of misclassification when deciding whether to control a covariate.},

We then extend these results to the case of more than one hidden layer. Our theoretical guarantees assume essentially nothing on the training data, and are verified numerically.

In this paper we propose and analyze a new robust algorithm for bottom-up agglomerative clustering. We show that our algorithm can be used to cluster accurately in cases where the data satisfies a number of natural properties and where the traditional agglomerative algorithms fail. We also show how to adapt our algorithm to the inductive setting where our given data is only a small random sample of the entire data set. Experimental evaluations on synthetic and real world data sets show that our algorithm consistently achieves better performance than other hierarchical algorithms in the presence of noise.},

abstract = {Mean shift clustering is a powerful nonparametric technique that does not require prior knowledge of the number of clusters and does not constrain the shape of the clusters. However, being completely unsupervised, its performance suffers when the original distance metric fails to capture the underlying cluster structure. Despite recent advances in semi-supervised clustering methods, there has been little effort towards incorporating supervision into mean shift. We propose a semi-supervised framework for kernel mean shift clustering (SKMS) that uses only pairwise constraints to guide the clustering procedure. The points are first mapped to a high-dimensional kernel space where the constraints are imposed by a linear transformation of the mapped points.

abstract = {Missing data are a recurring problem that can cause bias or lead to inefficient analyses. Development of statistical methods to address missingness have been actively pursued in recent years, including imputation, likelihood and weighting approaches. Each approach is more complicated when there are many patterns of missing values, or when both categorical and continuous random variables are involved. Implementations of routines to incorporate observations with incomplete variables in regression models are now widely available. We review these routines in the context of a motivating example from a large health services research dataset. While there are still limitations to the current implementations, and additional efforts are required of the analyst, it is feasible to incorporate partially observed values, and these methods should be utilized in practice.},

The resulting notion of `safety' provides a fresh perspective on foundational issues in statistics, providing a middle ground between imprecise probability and multiple-prior models on the one hand and strictly Bayesian approaches on the other. It also allows us to formalize fiducial distributions in terms of the set of random variables that they can safely predict, thus taking some of the sting out of the fiducial idea. By restricting probabilistic inference to safe uses, one also automatically avoids paradoxes such as the Monty Hall problem. Safety comes in a variety of degrees, such as "validity" (the strongest notion), "calibration", "confidence safety" and "unbiasedness" (almost the weakest notion).},

Significant amounts of effort have been devoted to developing weakly supervised methods tailored to each individual setting, which are often carefully designed to take advantage of the particular properties of weak supervision regimes, form of available data and prior knowledge of the task at hand. Unfortunately, it is difficult to adapt these methods to new tasks and/or forms of data, which often require different weak supervision regimes or models. We present a general-purpose method that can solve any weakly supervised learning problem irrespective of the weak supervision regime or the model. The proposed method turns any off-the-shelf strongly supervised classifier into a weakly supervised classifier and allows the user to specify any arbitrary weakly supervision regime via a loss function. We apply the method to several different weak supervision regimes and demonstrate competitive results compared to methods specifically engineered for those settings.},

abstract = {Structural equation models (SEMs) have been widely adopted for inference of causal interactions in complex networks. Recent examples include unveiling topologies of hidden causal networks over which processes such as spreading diseases, or rumors propagate. The appeal of SEMs in these settings stems from their simplicity and tractability, since they typically assume linear dependencies among observable variables. Acknowledging the limitations inherent to adopting linear models, the present paper advocates nonlinear SEMs, which account for (possible) nonlinear dependencies among network nodes. The advocated approach leverages kernels as a powerful encompassing framework for nonlinear modeling, and an efficient estimator with affordable tradeoffs is put forth. Interestingly, pursuit of the novel kernel-based approach yields a convex regularized estimator that promotes edge sparsity, and is amenable to proximal-splitting optimization methods. To this end, solvers with complementary merits are developed by leveraging the alternating direction method of multipliers, and proximal gradient iterations. Experiments conducted on simulated data demonstrate that the novel approach outperforms linear SEMs with respect to edge detection errors. Furthermore, tests on a real gene expression dataset unveil interesting new edges that were not revealed by linear SEMs, which could shed more light on regulatory behavior of human genes.},

abstract = {We describe and develop a close relationship between two problems that have customarily been regarded as distinct: that of maximizing entropy, and that of minimizing worst-case expected loss.  Using a formulation grounded in the equilibrium theory of zero-sum games between Decision Maker and Nature, these two problems are shown to be dual to each other, the solution to each providing that to the other.  Although Topsoe described this connection for the Shannon entropy over 20 years ago, it does not appear to be widely known even in that important special case. 

We here generalize this theory to apply to arbitrary decision problems and loss functions.  We indicate how an appropriate generalized definition of entropy can be associated with such a problem, and we show that, subject to certain regularity conditions, the above-mentioned duality continues to apply in this extended context.  This simultaneously provides a possible rationale for maximizing entropy and a tool for finding robust Bayes acts.  We also describe the essential identity between the problem of maximizing entropy and that of minimizing a related discrepancy or divergence between distributions.  This leads to an extension, to arbitrary discrepancies, of a well-known minimax theorem for the case of Kullback-Leibler divergence (the "redundancy-capacity theorem'' of information theory).  For the important case of families of distributions having certain mean values specified, we develop simple sufficient conditions and methods for identifying the desired solutions.},

@article{Qiu2013,
abstract = {A low-rank transformation learning framework for subspace clustering and classification is here proposed. Many high-dimensional data, such as face images and motion sequences, approximately lie in a union of low-dimensional subspaces. The corresponding subspace clustering problem has been extensively studied in the literature to partition such high-dimensional data into clusters corresponding to their underlying low-dimensional subspaces. However, low-dimensional intrinsic structures are often violated for real-world observations, as they can be corrupted by errors or deviate from ideal models. We propose to address this by learning a linear transformation on subspaces using matrix rank, via its convex surrogate nuclear norm, as the optimization criteria. The learned linear transformation restores a low-rank structure for data from the same subspace, and, at the same time, forces a high-rank structure for data from different subspaces. In this way, we reduce variations within the subspaces, and increase separation between the subspaces for a more robust subspace clustering. This proposed learned robust subspace clustering framework significantly enhances the performance of existing subspace clustering methods. Basic theoretical results here presented help to further support the underlying framework. To exploit the low-rank structures of the transformed subspaces, we further introduce a fast subspace clustering technique, called Robust Sparse Subspace Clustering, which efficiently combines robust PCA with sparse modeling. When class labels are present at the training stage, we show this low-rank transformation framework also significantly enhances classification performance. Extensive experiments using public datasets are presented, showing that the proposed approach significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods for subspace clustering and classification.},

abstract = {Improvement guarantees for semi-supervised classifiers can currently only be given under restrictive conditions on the data. We propose a general way to perform semi-supervised parameter estimation for likelihood-based classifiers for which, on the full training set, the estimates are never worse than the supervised solution in terms of the log-likelihood. We argue, moreover, that we may expect these solutions to really improve upon the supervised classifier in particular cases. In a worked-out example for LDA, we take it one step further and essentially prove that its semi-supervised version is strictly better than its supervised counterpart. The two new concepts that form the core of our estimation principle are contrast and pessimism. The former refers to the fact that our objective function takes the supervised estimates into account, enabling the semi-supervised solution to explicitly control the potential improvements over this estimate. The latter refers to the fact that our estimates are conservative and therefore resilient to whatever form the true labeling of the unlabeled data takes on. Experiments demonstrate the improvements in terms of both the log-likelihood and the classification error rate on independent test sets.},

abstract = {Supervised learning for classification of cancer employs a set of design examples to learn how to discriminate between tumors. In practice it is crucial to confirm that the classifier is robust with good generalization performance to new examples, or at least that it performs better than random guessing. A suggested alternative is to obtain a confidence interval of the error rate using repeated design and test sets selected from available examples. However, it is known that even in the ideal situation of repeated designs and tests with completely novel samples in each cycle, a small test set size leads to a large bias in the estimate of the true variance between design sets. Therefore different methods for small sample performance estimation such as a recently proposed procedure called Repeated Random Sampling (RSS) is also expected to result in heavily biased estimates, which in turn translates into biased confidence intervals. Here we explore such biases and develop a refined algorithm called Repeated Independent Design and Test (RIDT).},

The Bayes rule will still produce nice looking estimates and credible intervals, but these lack the logical force that is attached to experience-based priors and require further justification. The paper concerns the frequentist assessment of Bayes estimates. A simple for-mula is shown to give the frequentist standard deviation of a Bayesian point estimate. The same simulations as required for the point estimate also produce the standard deviation. Exponen-tial family models make the calculations particularly simple and bring in a connection to the parametric bootstrap.},

abstract = {Regularized empirical risk minimization with constrained labels (in contrast to fixed labels) is a remarkably general abstraction of learning. For common loss and regularization functions, this optimization problem assumes the form of a mixed integer program (MIP) whose objective function is non-convex. In this form, the problem is resistant to standard optimization techniques. We construct MIPs with the same solutions whose objective functions are convex. Specifically, we characterize the tightest convex extension of the objective function, given by the Legendre-Fenchel biconjugate. Computing values of this tightest convex extension is NP-hard. However, by applying our characterization to every function in an additive decomposition of the objective function, we obtain a class of looser convex extensions that can be computed efficiently. For some decompositions, common loss and regularization functions, we derive a closed form.},

abstract = {When applying hierarchical clustering algorithms to cluster patient samples from microarray data, the clustering patterns generated by most algorithms tend to be dominated by groups of highly differentially expressed genes that have closely related expression patterns. Sometimes, these genes may not be relevant to the biological process under study or their functions may already be known. The problem is that these genes can potentially drown out the effects of other genes that are relevant or have novel functions. We propose a procedure called complementary hierarchical clustering that is designed to uncover the structures arising from these novel genes that are not as highly expressed. Simulation studies show that the procedure is effective when applied to a variety of examples. We also define a concept called relative gene importance that can be used to identify the influential genes in a given clustering. Finally, we analyze a microarray data set from 295 breast cancer patients, using clustering with the correlation-based distance measure. The complementary clustering reveals a grouping of the patients which is uncorrelated with a number of known prognostic signatures and significantly differing distant metastasis-free probabilities.},

Observed values of the potential outcomes are revealed by the assignment mechanism—a probabilistic model for the treatment each unit receives as a function of covariates and potential outcomes. Fisher made tremendous contributions to causal inference through his work on the design of randomized experiments, but the potential outcomes perspective applies to other complex experiments and nonrandomized studies as well. As noted by Kempthorne in his 1976 discussion of Savage's Fisher lecture, Fisher never bridged his work on experimental design and his work on parametric modeling, a bridge that appears nearly automatic with an appropriate view of the potential outcomes framework, where the potential outcomes and covariates are given a Bayesian distribution to complete the model specification. Also, this framework crisply separates scientific inference for causal effects and decisions based on s...},

Methods are compared and illustrated when missing data are confined to one independent variable, and extensions to more general patterns are indicated. Attention is paid to the performance of methods when the missing data are not missing completely at random. Least squares methods that fill in missing X's using only data on the X's are contrasted with likelihood-based methods that use data on the X's and Y. The latter approach is preferred and provides methods for elaboration of the basic normal linear regression model. It is suggested that more widely distributed software is needed that advances beyond complete-case analysis, available-case analysis, and naive imputation methods. Bayesian simulation methods and multiple imputation are reviewed; these provide fruitful avenues for future research.},

abstract = {Recent works demonstrated the usefulness of temporal coherence to regularize supervised training or to learn invariant features with deep architectures. In particular, enforcing a smooth output change while presenting temporally-closed frames from video sequences, proved to be an effective strategy. In this paper we prove the efficacy of temporal coherence for semi-supervised incremental tuning. We show that a deep architecture, just mildly trained in a supervised manner, can progressively improve its classification accuracy, if exposed to video sequences of unlabeled data. The extent to which, in some cases, a semi-supervised tuning allows to improve classification accuracy (approaching the supervised one) is somewhat surprising. A number of control experiments pointed out the fundamental role of temporal coherence.},

@article{Wang2016a,
abstract = {In adaptive data analysis, the user makes a sequence of queries on the data, where at each step the choice of query may depend on the results in previous steps. The releases are often randomized in order to reduce overfitting for such adaptively chosen queries. In this paper, we propose a minimax framework for adaptive data analysis. Assuming Gaussianity of queries, we establish the first sharp minimax lower bound on the squared error in the order of {\$}O(\backslashfrac{\{}\backslashsqrt{\{}k{\}}\backslashsigma{\^{}}2{\}}{\{}n{\}}){\$}, where {\$}k{\$} is the number of queries asked, and {\$}\backslashsigma{\^{}}2/n{\$} is the ordinary signal-to-noise ratio for a single query. Our lower bound is based on the construction of an approximately least favorable adversary who picks a sequence of queries that are most likely to be affected by overfitting. This approximately least favorable adversary uses only one level of adaptivity, suggesting that the minimax risk for 1-step adaptivity with k-1 initial releases and that for {\$}k{\$}-step adaptivity are on the same order. The key technical component of the lower bound proof is a reduction to finding the convoluting distribution that optimally obfuscates the sign of a Gaussian signal. Our lower bound construction also reveals a transparent and elementary proof of the matching upper bound as an alternative approach to Russo and Zou (2015), who used information-theoretic tools to provide the same upper bound. We believe that the proposed framework opens up opportunities to obtain theoretical insights for many other settings of adaptive data analysis, which would extend the idea to more practical realms.},

@article{Kawakita2014a,
abstract = {We are interested in developing a safe semi-supervised learning that works in any situation. Semi-supervised learning postulates that n(') unlabeled data are available in addition to n labeled data. However, almost all of the previous semi-supervised methods require additional assumptions (not only unlabeled data) to make improvements on supervised learning. If such assumptions are not met, then the methods possibly perform worse than supervised learning. Sokolovska, Capp{\'{e}}, and Yvon (2008) proposed a semi-supervised method based on a weighted likelihood approach. They proved that this method asymptotically never performs worse than supervised learning (i.e., it is safe) without any assumption. Their method is attractive because it is easy to implement and is potentially general. Moreover, it is deeply related to a certain statistical paradox. However, the method of Sokolovska et al. (2008) assumes a very limited situation, i.e., classification, discrete covariates, n(')→∞ and a maximum likelihood estimator. In this paper, we extend their method by modifying the weight. We prove that our proposal is safe in a significantly wide range of situations as long as n≤n('). Further, we give a geometrical interpretation of the proof of safety through the relationship with the above-mentioned statistical paradox. Finally, we show that the above proposal is asymptotically safe even when n('){\textless}n by modifying the weight. Numerical experiments illustrate the performance of these methods.},
