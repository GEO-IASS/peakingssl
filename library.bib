@article{Alaoui2016,
abstract = {Given a weighted graph with {\$}N{\$} vertices, consider a real-valued regression problem in a semi-supervised setting, where one observes {\$}n{\$} labeled vertices, and the task is to label the remaining ones. We present a theoretical study of {\$}\backslashell{\_}p{\$}-based Laplacian regularization under a {\$}d{\$}-dimensional geometric random graph model. We provide a variational characterization of the performance of this regularized learner as {\$}N{\$} grows to infinity while {\$}n{\$} stays constant, the associated optimality conditions lead to a partial differential equation that must be satisfied by the associated function estimate {\$}\backslashhat{\{}f{\}}{\$}. From this formulation we derive several predictions on the limiting behavior the {\$}d{\$}-dimensional function {\$}\backslashhat{\{}f{\}}{\$}, including (a) a phase transition in its smoothness at the threshold {\$}p = d + 1{\$}, and (b) a tradeoff between smoothness and sensitivity to the underlying unlabeled data distribution {\$}P{\$}. Thus, over the range {\$}p \backslashleq d{\$}, the function estimate {\$}\backslashhat{\{}f{\}}{\$} is degenerate and "spiky," whereas for {\$}p\backslashgeq d+1{\$}, the function estimate {\$}\backslashhat{\{}f{\}}{\$} is smooth. We show that the effect of the underlying density vanishes monotonically with {\$}p{\$}, such that in the limit {\$}p = \backslashinfty{\$}, corresponding to the so-called Absolutely Minimal Lipschitz Extension, the estimate {\$}\backslashhat{\{}f{\}}{\$} is independent of the distribution {\$}P{\$}. Under the assumption of semi-supervised smoothness, ignoring {\$}P{\$} can lead to poor statistical performance, in particular, we construct a specific example for {\$}d=1{\$} to demonstrate that {\$}p=2{\$} has lower risk than {\$}p=\backslashinfty{\$} due to the former penalty adapting to {\$}P{\$} and the latter ignoring it. We also provide simulations that verify the accuracy of our predictions for finite sample sizes. Together, these properties show that {\$}p = d+1{\$} is an optimal choice, yielding a function estimate {\$}\backslashhat{\{}f{\}}{\$} that is both smooth and non-degenerate, while remaining maximally sensitive to {\$}P{\$}.},

@article{Meding2012,
abstract = {In clinical diagnostics, it is of outmost importance to correctly identify the source of a metastatic tumor, especially if no apparent primary tumor is present. Tissue-based proteomics might allow correct tumor classification. As a result, we performed MALDI imaging to generate proteomic signatures for different tumors. These signatures were used to classify common cancer types. At first, a cohort comprised of tissue samples from six adenocarcinoma entities located at different organ sites (esophagus, breast, colon, liver, stomach, thyroid gland, n = 171) was classified using two algorithms for a training and test set. For the test set, Support Vector Machine and Random Forest yielded overall accuracies of 82.74 and 81.18{\%}, respectively. Then, colon cancer liver metastasis samples (n = 19) were introduced into the classification. The liver metastasis samples could be discriminated with high accuracy from primary tumors of colon cancer and hepatocellular carcinoma. Additionally, colon cancer liver metastasis samples could be successfully classified by using colon cancer primary tumor samples for the training of the classifier. These findings demonstrate that MALDI imaging-derived proteomic classifiers can discriminate between different tumor types at different organ sites and in the same site.},

When making direct-likelihood or Bayesian inferences about $\theta$, it is appropriate to ignore the process that causes missing data if the missing data are missing at random and the parameter of the missing data process is ‘distinct' from $\theta$. These conditions are the weakest general conditions under which ignoring the process that causes missing data always leads to correct inferences.},

abstract = {We consider the problem of clustering observations using a potentially large set of features. One might expect that the true underlying clusters present in the data differ only with respect to a small fraction of the features, and will be missed if one clusters the observations using the full set of features. We propose a novel framework for sparse clustering, in which one clusters the observations using an adaptively chosen subset of the features. The method uses a lasso-type penalty to select the features. We use this framework to develop simple methods for sparse K-means and sparse hierarchical clustering. A single criterion governs both the selection of the features and the resulting clusters. These approaches are demonstrated on simulated data and on genomic data sets.},

abstract = {We present a series of new theoretical, algorithmic, and empirical results for domain adaptation and sample bias correction in regression. We prove that the discrepancy is a distance for the squared loss when the hypothesis set is the reproducing kernel Hilbert space induced by a universal kernel such as the Gaussian kernel. We give new pointwise loss guarantees based on the discrepancy of the empirical source and target distributions for the general class of kernel-based regularization algorithms. These bounds have a simpler form than previous results and hold for a broader class of convex loss functions not necessarily differentiable, including Lq losses and the hinge loss. We also give finer bounds based on the discrepancy and a weighted feature discrepancy parameter. We extend the discrepancy minimization adaptation algorithm to the more significant case where kernels are used and show that the problem can be cast as an SDP similar to the one in the feature space. We also show that techniques from smooth optimization can be used to derive an efficient algorithm for solving such SDPs even for very high-dimensional feature spaces and large samples. We have implemented this algorithm and report the results of experiments both with artificial and real-world data sets demonstrating its benefits both for general scenario of adaptation and the more specific scenario of sample bias correction. Our results show that it can scale to large data sets of tens of thousands or more points and demonstrate its performance improvement benefits. ?? 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {The jump from problem sets to research can be hard. We sometimes see students who ace their classes struggle with their research. In little bites, here is what I think is important for succeeding in research as a graduate student. • The first advice can go on a bumper sticker: " Slow down to speed up " . In classes, the world is rigged. There's a simple correct answer and the problem is structured to let you come to that answer. You get feedback with the correct answer within a day after you submit anything. Research is different. No one tells you the right answer, we don't know if there is a right answer. We don't know if something doesn't work because there's a silly mistake in the program or because a broad set of assumptions is flawed. How do you deal with that? Take things slowly. Verify your assumptions. Understand the thing, whatever it is–the program, the algorithm, or the proof. As you do experiments, only change one thing at a time, so you know what the outcome of the experiment means. It may feel like you're going slowly, but you'll be making much more progress than if you flail around, trying different things, but not understanding what's going on. Figure 1: Research advice for a bumper sticker. • Please don't tell me " it doesn't work " . Of course it doesn't work. If there's a single mistake in the chain, the whole thing won't work, and how could you possibly go through all those steps without making a mistake somewhere? What I want to hear instead is something like, " I've narrowed down the problem to step B. Until step A, you can see that it works, because you put in X and you get Y out, as we expect. You can see how it fails here at B. I've ruled out W and Z as the cause. " • " This sounds like hard work. " Yes. It's no longer about being smart. By now, everyone around you is smart. In graduate school, it's the hard workers who pull ahead. This happens in sports, too. You always read stories about how hard the great players work, being the first ones out to practice, the last ones to leave, etc.},

@article{Bruand2011,
abstract = {Mass Spectrometric Imaging (MSI) is a molecular imaging technique that allows the generation of 2D ion density maps for a large complement of the active molecules present in cells and sectioned tissues. Automatic segmentation of such maps according to patterns of co-expression of individual molecules can be used for discovery of novel molecular signatures (molecules that are specifically expressed in particular spatial regions). However, current segmentation techniques are biased toward the discovery of higher abundance molecules and large segments; they allow limited opportunity for user interaction, and validation is usually performed by similarity to known anatomical features. We describe here a novel method, AMASS (Algorithm for MSI Analysis by Semi-supervised Segmentation). AMASS relies on the discriminating power of a molecular signal instead of its intensity as a key feature, uses an internal consistency measure for validation, and allows significant user interaction and supervision as options. An automated segmentation of entire leech embryo data images resulted in segmentation domains congruent with many known organs, including heart, CNS ganglia, nephridia, nephridiopores, and lateral and ventral regions, each with a distinct molecular signature. Likewise, segmentation of a rat brain MSI slice data set yielded known brain features and provided interesting examples of co-expression between distinct brain regions. AMASS represents a new approach for the discovery of peptide masses with distinct spatial features of expression. Software source code and installation and usage guide are available at http://bix.ucsd.edu/AMASS/ .},

We prove that for a MNN with one hidden layer, the training error is zero at every differentiable local minimum, for almost every dataset and dropout-like noise realization. We then extend these results to the case of more than one hidden layer. Our theoretical guarantees assume essentially nothing on the training data, and are verified numerically. These results suggest why the highly non-convex loss of such MNNs can be easily optimized using local updates (e.g., stochastic gradient descent), as observed empirically.},

abstract = {Written by one of the pre-eminent researchers in the field, this book provides a comprehensive exposition of modern analysis of causation. It shows how causality has grown from a nebulous concept into a mathematical theory with significant applications in the fields of statistics, artificial intelligence, philosophy, cognitive science, and the health and social sciences. Pearl presents a unified account of the probabilistic, manipulative, counterfactual and structural approaches to causation, and devises simple mathematical tools for analyzing the relationships between causal connections, statistical associations, actions and observations. The book will open the way for including causal analysis in the standard curriculum of statistics, artifical intelligence, business, epidemiology, social science and economics. Students in these areas will find natural models, simple identification procedures, and precise mathematical definitions of causal concepts that traditional texts have tended to evade or make unduly complicated. This book will be of interest to professionals and students in a wide variety of fields. Anyone who wishes to elucidate meaningful relationships from data, predict effects of actions and policies, assess explanations of reported events, or form theories of causal understanding and causal speech will find this book stimulating and invaluable.

@article{VanErven2015,
abstract = {The pursuit of fast rates in online and statistical learning has led to the conception of many conditions in learning theory under which fast learning is possible. We show that most of these conditions are special cases of a single, unifying condition, that comes in two forms: the central condition for 'proper' learning algorithms that always output a hypothesis in the given model, and stochastic mixability for online algorithms that may make predictions outside of the model. We show that, under surprisingly weak conditions, both conditions are, in a certain sense, equivalent. The central condition has a re-interpretation in terms of convexity of a set of pseudoprobabilities, linking it to density estimation under misspecification. For bounded losses, we show how the central condition enables a direct proof of fast rates and we prove its equivalence to the Bernstein condition, itself a generalization of the Tsybakov-Mammen margin condition, which has played a central role in obtaining fast rates in statistical learning. Yet, while the Bernstein condition is two-sided, the central condition is one-sided, making it more suitable to deal with unbounded losses. In its stochastic mixability form, our condition generalizes both a stochastic exp-concavity condition identified by Juditsky, Rigollet and Tsybakov, and Vovk's notion of mixability. Our unifying conditions thus provide a significant step towards a characterization of fast rates in statistical learning, similar to how classical mixability characterizes constant regret in the sequential prediction with expert advice setting.},

abstract = {In many situations we have some measurement of confidence on " positiveness " for a binary label. The " positiveness " is a continuous value whose range is a bounded interval. It quantifies the affiliation of each training data to the positive class. We propose a novel learning algorithm called expectation loss SVM (e-SVM) that is devoted to the problems where only the " positiveness " instead of a binary label of each training sample is available. Our e-SVM algorithm can also be readily extended to learn segment classifiers under weak supervision where the exact positiveness value of each training example is unobserved. In experiments, we show that the e-SVM algorithm can effectively address the segment proposal classification task under both strong supervision (e.g. the pixel-level annotations are available) and the weak supervision (e.g. only bounding-box annotations are available), and outperforms the alternative approaches. Besides, we further vali-date this method on two major tasks of computer vision: semantic segmentation and object detection. Our method achieves the state-of-the-art object detection performance on PASCAL VOC 2007 dataset.},

There seems to be a wide spread view that we need to do something to address this problem, as it is essential to the advancement of our field. The most compelling argument would seem to be that reproducibility of experimental results is the hallmark of science. Therefore, given that most of us regard machine learning as a scientific discipline, being able to replicate experiments is paramount. I want to challenge this view by separating the notion of reproducibility, a generally desirable property, from replicability, its poor cousin. I claim there are important differences between the two. Reproducibility requires changes; replicability avoids them. Although reproducibility is desirable, I contend that the impoverished version, replicability, is one not worth having.},

When evaluated on DUC 2004-2007 corpora, we obtain better than existing state-of-art results in both generic and query-focused document summarization.

@article{Hanselmann2008,
abstract = {Imaging mass spectrometry (IMS) is a promising technology which allows for detailed analysis of spatial distributions of (bio)molecules in organic samples. In many current applications, IMS relies heavily on (semi)automated exploratory data analysis procedures to decompose the data into characteristic component spectra and corresponding abundance maps, visualizing spectral and spatial structure. The most commonly used techniques are principal component analysis (PCA) and independent component analysis (ICA). Both methods operate in an unsupervised manner. However, their decomposition estimates usually feature negative counts and are not amenable to direct physical interpretation. We propose probabilistic latent semantic analysis (pLSA) for non-negative decomposition and the elucidation of interpretable component spectra and abundance maps. We compare this algorithm to PCA, ICA, and non-negative PARAFAC (parallel factors analysis) and show on simulated and real-world data that pLSA and non-negative PARAFAC are superior to PCA or ICA in terms of complementarity of the resulting components and reconstruction accuracy. We further combine pLSA decomposition with a statistical complexity estimation scheme based on the Akaike information criterion (AIC) to automatically estimate the number of components present in a tissue sample data set and show that this results in sensible complexity estimates.},

(2006) recently proved that a ground condition for surrogates, classification calibration, ties up their consistent minimization to that of the classification risk, and left as an important problem the algorithmic questions about their minimization. In this paper, we address this problem for a wide set which lies at the intersection of classification calibrated surrogates and those of Murata et al. (2004). This set coincides with those satisfying three common assumptions about surrogates. Equivalent expressions for the members-sometimes well known-follow for convex and concave surrogates, frequently used in the induction of linear separators and decision trees. Most notably, they share remarkable algorithmic features: for each of these two types of classifiers, we give a minimization algorithm provably converging to the minimum of any such surrogate. While seemingly different, we show that these algorithms are offshoots of the same "master" algorithm. This provides a new and broad unified account of different popular algorithms, including additive regression with the squared loss, the logistic loss, and the top-down induction performed in CART, C4.5. Moreover, we show that the induction enjoys the most popular boosting features, regardless of the surrogate. Experiments are provided on 40 readily available domains.},

These closed-form kernels can be used as drop-in replacements for standard kernels, with benefits in expressive power and scalability. We jointly learn the properties of these kernels through the marginal likelihood of a Gaussian process. Inference and learning cost {\$}O(n){\$} for {\$}n{\$} training points, and predictions cost {\$}O(1){\$} per test point.

abstract = {Among the many applications of mass spectrometry, biomarker pattern discovery from protein mass spectra has aroused considerable interest in the past few years. While research efforts have raised hopes of early and less invasive diagnosis, they have also brought to light the many issues to be tackled before mass-spectra-based proteomic patterns become routine clinical tools. Known issues cover the entire pipeline leading from sample collection through mass spectrometry analytics to biomarker pattern extraction, validation, and interpretation. This study focuses on the data-analytical phase, which takes as input mass spectra of biological specimens and discovers patterns of peak masses and intensities that discriminate between different pathological states. We survey current work and investigate computational issues concerning the different stages of the knowledge discovery process: exploratory analysis, quality control, and diverse transforms of mass spectra, followed by further dimensionality reduction, classification, and model evaluation. We conclude after a brief discussion of the critical biomedical task of analyzing discovered discriminatory patterns to identify their component proteins as well as interpret and validate their biological implications.},

abstract = {Deep generative models based upon continuous variational distributions parameterized by deep networks give state-of-the-art performance. In this paper we propose a framework for extending the latent representation with extra auxiliary variables in order to make the variational distribution more expressive for semi-supervised learning. By utilizing the stochasticity of the auxiliary variable we demonstrate how to train discriminative classifiers resulting in state-of-the-art performance within semi-supervised learning exemplified by an 0.96{\%} error on MNIST using 100 labeled data points. Furthermore we observe empirically that using auxiliary variables increases convergence speed suggesting that less expressive variational distributions, not only lead to looser bounds but also slower model training.},

@article{Yu2006,
abstract = {This paper considers the problem of selecting the most informative experiments x to get measurements y for learning a regression model y = f(x). We propose a novel and simple concept for active learning, transductive experimental design, that explores available unmeasured experiments (i.e., unlabeled data) and has a better scalability in comparison with classic experimental design methods. Our in-depth analysis shows that the new method tends to favor experiments that are on the one side hard-to-predict and on the other side representative for the rest of the experiments. Efficient optimization of the new design problem is achieved through alternating optimization and sequential greedy search. Extensive experimental results on synthetic problems and three real-world tasks, including questionnaire design for preference learning, active learning for text categorization, and spatial sensor placement, highlight the advantages of the proposed approaches.},

Support Vector Machines are a wide spread approach for classifying biological data, due to their high accuracy, their ability to deal with structured data such as strings, and the ease to integrate various types of data. However, it is unclear how to correct for confounding factors such as population structure, age or gender or experimental conditions in Support Vector Machine classification.},

abstract = {The success of machine learning algorithms generally depends on data representation, and we hypothesize that this is because different representations can entangle and hide more or less the different explanatory factors of variation behind the data. Although specific domain knowledge can be used to help design representations, learning with generic priors can also be used, and the quest for AI is motivating the design of more powerful representation-learning algorithms implementing such priors. This paper reviews recent work in the area of unsupervised feature learning and deep learning, covering advances in probabilistic models, autoencoders, manifold learning, and deep networks. This motivates longer term unanswered questions about the appropriate objectives for learning good representations, for computing representations (i.e., inference), and the geometrical connections between representation learning, density estimation, and manifold learning.},

abstract = {Regularized empirical risk minimization with constrained labels (in contrast to fixed labels) is a remarkably general abstraction of learning. For common loss and regularization functions, this optimization problem assumes the form of a mixed integer program (MIP) whose objective function is non-convex. In this form, the problem is resistant to standard optimization techniques. We construct MIPs with the same solutions whose objective functions are convex. Specifically, we characterize the tightest convex extension of the objective function, given by the Legendre-Fenchel biconjugate. Computing values of this tightest convex extension is NP-hard. However, by applying our characterization to every function in an additive decomposition of the objective function, we obtain a class of looser convex extensions that can be computed efficiently. For some decompositions, common loss and regularization functions, we derive a closed form.},

abstract = {A purely peer-to-peer version of electronic cash would allow online payments to be sent directly from one party to another without going through a financial institution. Digital signatures provide part of the solution, but the main benefits are lost if a trusted third party is still required to prevent double-spending. We propose a solution to the double-spending problem using a peer-to-peer network. The network timestamps transactions by hashing them into an ongoing chain of hash-based proof-of-work, forming a record that cannot be changed without redoing the proof-of-work. The longest chain not only serves as proof of the sequence of events witnessed, but proof that it came from the largest pool of CPU power. As long as a majority of CPU power is controlled by nodes that are not cooperating to attack the network, they'll generate the longest chain and outpace attackers. The network itself requires minimal structure. Messages are broadcast on a best effort basis, and nodes can leave and rejoin the network at will, accepting the longest proof-of-work chain as proof of what happened while they were gone.},

abstract = {MOTIVATION: Building an accurate protein classification system depends critically upon choosing a good representation of the input sequences of amino acids. Recent work using string kernels for protein data has achieved state-of-the-art classification performance. However, such representations are based only on labeled data--examples with known 3D structures, organized into structural classes--whereas in practice, unlabeled data are far more plentiful. RESULTS: In this work, we develop simple and scalable cluster kernel techniques for incorporating unlabeled data into the representation of protein sequences. We show that our methods greatly improve the classification performance of string kernels and outperform standard approaches for using unlabeled data, such as adding close homologs of the positive examples to the training data. We achieve equal or superior performance to previously presented cluster kernel methods and at the same time achieving far greater computational efficiency.

abstract = {One of the nice properties of kernel classifiers such as SVMs is that they often produce sparse solutions. However, the decision functions of these classifiers cannot always be used to estimate the conditional probability of the class label. We investigate the relationship between these two properties and show that these are intimately related: sparseness does not occur when the conditional probabilities can be unambiguously estimated. We consider a family of convex loss functions and derive sharp asymptotic results for the fraction of data that becomes support vectors. This enables us to characterize the exact trade-off between sparseness and the ability to estimate conditional probabilities for these loss functions.},

abstract = {A recurring problem with statistical prediction for policy-making is that many useful variables are associated with others on which it would be ethically problematic to base decisions. This problem becomes particularly acute in the Big Data era, when predictions are often made in the absence of strong theories for the underlying causal mechanisms. Given this, we show how to use information theory to construct the distribution closest in predictive power to the full distribution, but in which predictions---and thus policy outcomes, provision of services, and so forth---are not correlated with protected variables.},

abstract = {In many applications, observations are available with different views. This is, for example, the case with image-text classification, multilingual document classification or document classification on the web. In addition, unlabeled multiview examples can be easily acquired, but assigning labels to these examples is usually a time consuming task. We describe a multiview self-learning strategy which trains different voting classifiers on different views. The margin distributions over the unlabeled training data, obtained with each view-specific classifier are then used to estimate an upper-bound on their transductive Bayes error. Minimizing this upper-bound provides an automatic margin-threshold which is used to assign pseudo-labels to unlabeled examples. Final class labels are then assigned to these examples, by taking a vote on the pool of the previous pseudo-labels. New view-specific classifiers are then trained using the labeled and pseudo-labeled training data. We consider applications to image-text classification and to multilingual document classification. We present experimental results on the NUS-WIDE collection and on Reuters RCV1-RCV2 which show that despite its simplicity, our approach is competitive with other state-of-the-art techniques.},

In this modeling scenario, the relationship between labeled and unlabeled data impacts the construction and performance of classifiers, and therefore a semi-supervised learning framework is adopted. We propose a graph classifier based on kernel smoothing. A regularization framework is also introduced, and it is shown that the proposed classifier optimizes certain loss functions. Its performance is assessed on several synthetic and real benchmark data sets with good results, especially in settings where only a small fraction of the data are labeled.},

@article{VanderKooi2013,
abstract = {OBJECTIVES: We investigated how much the Human Development Index (HDI), a global measure of development, modifies the effect of education on self-reported health.

METHODS: We analyzed cross-sectional World Health Survey data on 217,642 individuals from 49 countries, collected in 2002 to 2005, with random-intercept multilevel linear regression models.

RESULTS: We observed greater positive associations between educational levels and self-reported good health with increasing HDI. The magnitude of this effect modification of the education-health relation tended to increase with educational attainment. For example, before adjustment for effect modification, at comparable HDI, on average, finishing primary school was associated with better general health (b = 1.49; 95{\%} confidence interval [CI] = 1.18, 1.80). With adjustment for effect modification by HDI, the impact became 4.63 (95{\%} CI = 3.63, 5.62) for every 0.1 increase in HDI. Among those who completed high school, these associations were, respectively, 5.59 (95{\%} CI = 5.20, 5.98) and 9.95 (95{\%} CI = 8.89, 11.00).

CONCLUSIONS: The health benefits of educational attainment are greater in countries with greater human development. Health inequalities attributable to education are, therefore, larger in more developed countries.},

abstract = {We are at the beginning of the multicore era. Computers will have increasingly many cores (processors), but there is still no good programming framework for these architectures, and thus no simple and unified way for machine learning to take advantage of the potential speed up. In this paper, we develop a broadly ap- plicable parallel programming method, one that is easily applied to many different learning algorithms. Our work is in distinct contrast to the tradition in machine learning of designing (often ingenious) ways to speed up a single algorithm at a time. Specifically, we show that algorithms that fit the Statistical Query model [15] can be written in a certain “summation form,” which allows them to be easily par- allelized on multicore computers. We adapt Google's map-reduce [7] paradigm to demonstrate this parallel speed up technique on a variety of learning algorithms including locally weighted linear regression (LWLR), k-means, logistic regres- sion (LR), naive Bayes (NB), SVM, ICA, PCA, gaussian discriminant analysis (GDA), EM, and backpropagation (NN). Our experimental results show basically linear speedup with an increasing number of processors.},

The Bayes rule will still produce nice looking estimates and credible intervals, but these lack the logical force that is attached to experience-based priors and require further justification. The paper concerns the frequentist assessment of Bayes estimates. A simple for-mula is shown to give the frequentist standard deviation of a Bayesian point estimate. The same simulations as required for the point estimate also produce the standard deviation. Exponen-tial family models make the calculations particularly simple and bring in a connection to the parametric bootstrap.},

Starting from these simple ingredients, we can construct: Proper Scoring Rule; Entropy Function; Divergence Function; Riemannian Metric; and Unbiased Estimating Equation. From an abstract viewpoint, the loss function defines a duality between the outcome and action spaces, while the correspondence between a distribution and its Bayes act induces a self-duality. Together these determine a "decision geometry" for the family of distributions on outcome space. This allows generalisation of many standard statistical concepts and properties. In particular we define and study generalised exponential families. Several examples are analysed, including a general Bregman geometry.},

abstract = {This work characterizes the generalization ability of algorithms whose predictions are linear in the input vector. To this end, we provide sharp bounds for Rademacher and Gaussian complexities of (constrained) linear classes, which directly lead to a number of generalization bounds. This derivation provides simpliﬁed proofs of a number of corollaries including: risk bounds for linear prediction (including settings where the weight vectors are constrained by either L2 or L1 constraints), margin bounds (including both L2 and L1 margins, along with more general notions based on relative entropy), a proof of the PAC-Bayes theorem, and upper bounds on L2 covering numbers (with Lp norm constraints and relative entropy constraints). In addition to providing a uniﬁed analysis, the results herein provide some of the sharpest risk and margin bounds. Interestingly, our results show that the uniform convergence rates of empirical risk minimization algorithms tightly match the regret bounds of online learning algorithms for linear prediction, up to a constant factor of 2.},

abstract = {We summarize the potential impact that the European Union's new General Data Protection Regulation will have on the routine use of machine learning algorithms. Slated to take effect as law across the EU in 2018, it will restrict automated individual decision-making (that is, algorithms that make decisions based on user-level predictors) which "significantly affect" users. The law will also create a "right to explanation," whereby a user can ask for an explanation of an algorithmic decision that was made about them. We argue that while this law will pose large challenges for industry, it highlights opportunities for machine learning researchers to take the lead in designing algorithms and evaluation frameworks which avoid discrimination.},

This is achieved by collecting together disparate observations and derivations made by many previous authors and introducing a new way of linking discrete and continuous state models using a simple nonlinearity. Through the use of other nonlinearities, we show how independent component analysis is also a variation of the same basic generative model. We show that factor analysis and mixtures of gaussians can be implemented in autoencoder neural networks and learned using squared error plus the same regularization term. We introduce a new model for static data, known as sensible principal component analysis, as well as a novel concept of spatially adaptive observation noise. We also review some of the literature involving global and local mixtures of the basic models and provide pseudocode for inference and learning for all the basic models.},

Label propagation is a transductive semi-supervised learning method that operates on the—most of the time undirected—data graph. It was introduced in [8] and since many variants were proposed. However, the base algorithm has two variants: the first variant presented in [8] and its slightly modified version used afterwards, e.g. in [7]. This paper presents and compares the two algorithms—both theoretically and experimentally—and also tries to make a recommendation which variant to use.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

abstract = {This paper presents Correlated Nystr¨ om Views (XNV), a fast semi-supervised al- gorithm for regression and classification. The algorithm draws on two main ideas. First, it generates two views consisting of computationally inexpensive random features. Second, multiview regression, using Canonical Correlation Analysis (CCA) on unlabeled data, biases the regression towards useful features. It has been shown that CCA regression can substantially reduce variance with a mini- mal increase in bias if the views contains accurate estimators. Recent theoretical and empirical work shows that regression with random features closely approxi- mates kernel regression, implying that the accuracy requirement holds for random views. We show that XNV consistently outperforms a state-of-the-art algorithm for semi-supervised learning: substantially improving predictive performance and reducing the variability of performance on a wide variety of real-world datasets, whilst also reducing runtime by orders of magnitude. 1},

The first test assesswhether the classifier has found a real class structure in the data; the corresponding null distribution is estimated by per- muting the labels in the data. This test has been used extensively in classification problems in computational biology. The second test studies whether the classifier is exploiting the dependency between the features in classification; the corresponding null distribution is estimated by permut- ing the features within classes, inspired by restricted randomization techniques traditionally used in statistics. This new test can serve to identify descriptive features which can be valuable infor- mation in improving the classifier performance. We study the properties of these tests and present an extensive empirical evaluation on real and synthetic data. Our analysis shows that studying the classifier performance via permutation tests is effective. In particular, the restricted permutation test clearly reveals whether the classifier exploits the interdependency between the features in the data.},

abstract = {We are interested in developing a safe semi-supervised learning that works in any situation. Semi-supervised learning postulates that n(') unlabeled data are available in addition to n labeled data. However, almost all of the previous semi-supervised methods require additional assumptions (not only unlabeled data) to make improvements on supervised learning. If such assumptions are not met, then the methods possibly perform worse than supervised learning. Sokolovska, Capp{\'{e}}, and Yvon (2008) proposed a semi-supervised method based on a weighted likelihood approach. They proved that this method asymptotically never performs worse than supervised learning (i.e., it is safe) without any assumption. Their method is attractive because it is easy to implement and is potentially general. Moreover, it is deeply related to a certain statistical paradox. However, the method of Sokolovska et al. (2008) assumes a very limited situation, i.e., classification, discrete covariates, n(')→∞ and a maximum likelihood estimator. In this paper, we extend their method by modifying the weight. We prove that our proposal is safe in a significantly wide range of situations as long as n≤n('). Further, we give a geometrical interpretation of the proof of safety through the relationship with the above-mentioned statistical paradox. Finally, we show that the above proposal is asymptotically safe even when n('){\textless}n by modifying the weight. Numerical experiments illustrate the performance of these methods.},

Sometimes, these genes may not be relevant to the biological process under study or their functions may already be known. The problem is that these genes can potentially drown out the effects of other genes that are relevant or have novel functions. We propose a procedure called complementary hierarchical clustering that is designed to uncover the structures arising from these novel genes that are not as highly expressed. Simulation studies show that the procedure is effective when applied to a variety of examples. We also define a concept called relative gene importance that can be used to identify the influential genes in a given clustering. Finally, we analyze a microarray data set from 295 breast cancer patients, using clustering with the correlation-based distance measure. The complementary clustering reveals a grouping of the patients which is uncorrelated with a number of known prognostic signatures and significantly differing distant metastasis-free probabilities.},

@article{Gelman1999,
abstract = {Maps are frequently used to display spatial distributions of parameters of interest, such as cancer rates or average pollutant concentrations by county. It is well known that plotting observed rates can have serious drawbacks when sample sizes vary by area, since very high (and low) observed rates are found disproportionately in poorly-sampled areas. Unfortunately, adjusting the observed rates to account for the effects of small-sample noise can introduce an opposite effect, in which the highest adjusted rates tend to be found disproportionately in well-sampled areas. In either case, the maps can be difficult to interpret because the display of spatial variation in the underlying parameters of interest is confounded with spatial variation in sample sizes. As a result, spatial patterns occur in adjusted rates even if there is no spatial structure in the underlying parameters of interest, and adjusted rates tend to look too uniform in areas with little data. We introduce two models (normal and Poisson) in which parameters of interest have no spatial patterns, and demonstrate the existence of spatial artefacts in inference from these models. We also discuss spatial models and the extent to which they are subject to the same artefacts. We present examples from Bayesian modelling, but, as we explain, the artefacts occur generally.},

@article{Lanckriet2002,
abstract = {When constructing a classifier, the probability of correct classification of future data points should be maximized. We consider a binary classification problem where the mean and covariance matrix of each class are assumed to be known. No further assumptions are made with respect to the class- conditional distributions. Misclassification probabilities are then controlled in a worst-case setting: that is, under all possible choices of class-conditional densities with given mean and covariance matrix, we minimize the worst-case (maximum) probability of misclassification of future data points. For a linear decision boundary, this desideratum is translated in a very direct way into a (convex) second order cone optimization problem, with complexity similar to a support vector machine problem. The minimax problem can be interpreted geometrically as minimizing the maximum of the Mahalanobis distances to the two classes. We address the issue of robustness with respect to estimation errors (in the means and covariances of the classes) via a simple modification of the input data. We also show how to exploit Mercer kernels in this setting to obtain nonlinear decision boundaries, yielding a classifier which proves to be competitive with current methods, including support vector machines. An important feature of this method is that a worst-case bound on the probability of misclassification of future data is always obtained explicitly},

We show that this principled kind of regularisation yields comparable performance to dropout on MNIST classification. We then demonstrate how the learnt uncertainty in the weights can be used to improve generalisation in non-linear regression problems, and how this weight uncertainty can be used to drive the exploration-exploitation trade-off in reinforce-ment learning.},

abstract = {An authentic food is one that is what it purports to be. Food processors and consumers need to be assured that, when they pay for a specific product or ingredient, they are receiving exactly what they pay for. Classification methods are an important tool in food authenticity studies where they are used to assign food samples of unknown type to known types. A classification method is developed where the classification rule is estimated by using both the labelled and the unlabelled data, in contrast with many classical methods which use only the labelled data for estimation. This methodology models the data as arising from a Gaussian mixture model with parsimonious covariance structure, as is done in model-based clustering. A missing data formulation of the mixture model is used and the models are fitted by using the EM and classification EM algorithms. The methods are applied to the analysis of spectra of food-stuffs recorded over the visible and near infra-red wavelength range in food authenticity studies. A comparison of the performance of model-based discriminant analysis and the method of classification proposed is given. The classification method proposed is shown to yield very good misclassification rates. The correct classification rate was observed to be as much as 15{\%} higher than the correct classification rate for model-based discriminant analysis.},

To effectively address this task, the state-of-the-art relies on strong assumptions regarding the mechanisms mapping causes to effects, such as invertibility or the existence of additive noise, which only hold in limited situations. On the contrary, this short paper proposes to learn how to perform causal inference directly from data, and without the need of feature engineering. In particular, we pose causality as a kernel mean embedding classification problem, where inputs are samples from arbitrary probability distributions on pairs of random variables, and labels are types of causal relationships. We validate the performance of our method on synthetic and real-world data against the state-of-the-art. Moreover, we submitted our algorithm to the ChaLearn's "Fast Causation Coefficient Challenge" competition, with which we won the fastest code prize and ranked third in the overall leaderboard.},

As well as clarifying relationships between generative and discriminative views of learning, the new machinery leads to tight and more general surrogate loss bounds and generalised Pinsker inequalities relating f-divergences to variational divergence. The new viewpoint illuminates existing algorithms: it provides a new derivation of Support Vector Machines in terms of divergences and relates Maximum Mean Discrepancy to Fisher Linear Discriminants. It also suggests new techniques for estimating f-divergences.},

@article{Amorim2016,
abstract = {The annotation of large data sets by a classifier is a problem whose challenge increases as the number of labeled samples used to train the classifier reduces in comparison to the number of unlabeled samples. In this context, semi-supervised learning methods aim at discovering and labeling informative samples among the unlabeled ones, such that their addition to the correct class in the training set can improve classification performance. We present a semi-supervised learning approach that connects unlabeled and labeled samples as nodes of a minimum-spanning tree and partitions the tree into an optimum-path forest rooted at the labeled nodes. It is suitable when most samples from a same class are more closely connected through sequences of nearby samples than samples from distinct classes, which is usually the case in data sets with a reasonable relation between number of samples and feature space dimension. The proposed solution is validated by using several data sets and state-of-the-art methods as baselines.},

@article{Li2015b,
abstract = {The scarcity of data annotated at the desired level of granularity is a recurring issue in many applications. Significant amounts of effort have been devoted to developing weakly supervised methods tailored to each individual setting, which are often carefully designed to take advantage of the particular properties of weak supervision regimes, form of available data and prior knowledge of the task at hand. Unfortunately, it is difficult to adapt these methods to new tasks and/or forms of data, which often require different weak supervision regimes or models. We present a general-purpose method that can solve any weakly supervised learning problem irrespective of the weak supervision regime or the model. The proposed method turns any off-the-shelf strongly supervised classifier into a weakly supervised classifier and allows the user to specify any arbitrary weakly supervision regime via a loss function. We apply the method to several different weak supervision regimes and demonstrate competitive results compared to methods specifically engineered for those settings.},

We show, contrary to a widely held belief that discriminative classifiers are almost always to be preferred, that there can often be two distinct regimes of performance as the training set size is increased, one in which each algorithm does better. This stems from the observation - which is borne out in repeated experiments - that while discriminative learning has lower asymptotic error, a generative classifier may also approach its (higher) asymptotic error much faster.},

We exploit a novel algorithm for capturing manifold structure (high-order contractive auto-encoders) and we showhowit builds a topological atlas of charts, each chart being characterized by the principal singular vectors of the Jacobian of a representation mapping. This representation learning algorithm can be stacked to yield a deep architecture, and we combine it with a domain knowledge-free version of the TangentProp algorithm to encourage the classifier to be insensitive to local directions changes along the manifold. Record-breaking classification results are obtained},

abstract = {Determinantal point processes (DPPs) are elegant probabilistic models of repulsion that arise in quantum physics and random matrix theory. In contrast to traditional structured models like Markov random fields, which become intractable and hard to approximate in the presence of negative correlations, DPPs offer efficient and exact algorithms for sampling, marginalization, conditioning, and other inference tasks. We provide a gentle introduction to DPPs, focusing on the intuitions, algorithms, and extensions that are most relevant to the machine learning community, and show how DPPs can be applied to real-world applications like finding diverse sets of high-quality search results, building informative summaries by selecting diverse sentences from documents, modeling non-overlapping human poses in images or video, and automatically building timelines of important news stories.},

abstract = {We present methods for dealing with missing variables in the context
  of Gaussian Processes and Support Vector Machines. This solves an
  important problem which has largely been ignored by kernel methods:
  How to systematically deal with incomplete data? Our method can also
  be applied to problems with partially observed labels as well as to
  the transductive setting where we view the labels as missing data.
  
  Our approach relies on casting kernel methods as an estimation
  problem in exponential families. Hence, estimation with missing
  variables becomes a problem of computing marginal distributions, and
  finding efficient optimization methods. To that extent we propose an
  optimization scheme which extends the Concave Convex Procedure (CCP)
  of Yuille and Rangarajan, and present a simplified and intuitive
  proof of its convergence. We show how our algorithm can be
  specialized to various cases in order to efficiently solve the
  optimization problems that arise. Encouraging preliminary
  experimental results on the USPS dataset are also presented.},

In particular, we consider a particular generalization of {\$}f{\$}-divergences to multiple distributions, and we show that there is a constructive equivalence between {\$}f{\$}-divergences, statistical information (in the sense of uncertainty as elaborated by DeGroot), and loss functions for multi-category classification. We also study an extension of our results to multi-class classification problems in which we must both infer a discriminant function {\$}\backslashgamma{\$} and a data representation (or, in the setting of a hypothesis testing problem, an experimental design), represented by a quantizer {\$}\backslashmathsf{\{}q{\}}{\$} from a family of possible quantizers {\$}\backslashmathsf{\{}Q{\}}{\$}. There, we give a complete characterization of the equivalence between loss functions, meaning that optimizing either of two losses yields the same optimal discriminant and quantizer {\$}\backslashmathsf{\{}q{\}}{\$}. A main consequence of our results is to describe those convex loss functions that are Fisher consistent for jointly choosing a data representation and minimizing the (weighted) probability of error in multi-category classification and hypothesis testing problems.},

Deriving variational inference algorithms requires tedious model-specific calculations; this makes it difficult to automate. We propose an automatic variational inference algorithm, automatic differentiation variational inference (ADVI). The user only provides a Bayesian model and a dataset; nothing else. We make no conjugacy assumptions and support a broad class of models. The algorithm automatically determines an appropriate variational family and optimizes the variational objective. We implement ADVI in Stan (code available now), a probabilistic programming framework. We compare ADVI to MCMC sampling across hierarchical generalized linear models, nonconjugate matrix factorization, and a mixture model. We train the mixture model on a quarter million images. With ADVI we can use variational inference on any model we write in Stan.},

While regionlevel models often feature dense pairwise connectivity, pixel-level models are considerably larger and have only permitted sparse graph structures. In this paper, we consider fully connected CRF models defined on the complete set of pixels in an image. The resulting graphs have billions of edges, making traditional inference algorithms impractical. Our main contribution is a highly efficient approximate inference algorithm for fully connected CRF models in which the pairwise edge potentials are defined by a linear combination of Gaussian kernels. Our experiments demonstrate that dense connectivity at the pixel level substantially improves segmentation and labeling accuracy.},

abstract = {It is well known that most of the common clustering objectives are NP-hard to optimize. In practice, however, clustering is being routinely carried out. One approach for providing theoretical understanding of this seeming discrepancy is to come up with notions of clusterability that distinguish realistically interesting input data from worst-case data sets. The hope is that there will be clustering algorithms that are provably efficient on such "clusterable" instances. This paper addresses the thesis that the computational hardness of clustering tasks goes away for inputs that one really cares about. In other words, that "Clustering is difficult only when it does not matter" (the $\backslash$emph{\{}CDNM thesis{\}} for short). I wish to present a a critical bird's eye overview of the results published on this issue so far and to call attention to the gap between available and desirable results on this issue. A longer, more detailed version of this note is available as arXiv:1507.05307. I discuss which requirements should be met in order to provide formal support to the the CDNM thesis and then examine existing results in view of these requirements and list some significant unsolved research challenges in that direction.},

We use 121 data sets, which represent the whole UCI data base (excluding the large-scale problems) and other own real problems, in order to achieve significant conclusions about the classifier behavior, not dependent on the data set col-lection. The classifiers most likely to be the bests are the random forest (RF) versions, the best of which (implemented in R and accessed via caret) achieves 94.1{\%} of the maximum accuracy overcoming 90{\%} in the 84.3{\%} of the data sets. However, the dif-ference is not statistically significant with the second best, the SVM with Gaussian kernel implemented in C using LibSVM, which achieves 92.3{\%} of the maximum accuracy. A few models are clearly better than the remaining ones: random forest, SVM with Gaussian and polynomial kernels, extreme learning machine with Gaussian kernel, C5.0 and avNNet (a committee of multi-layer perceptrons implemented in R with the caret package). The random forest is clearly the best family of classifiers (3 out of 5 bests classifiers are RF), followed by SVM (4 classifiers in the top-10), neural networks and boosting ensembles (5 and 3 members in the top-20, respectively).},

abstract = {Sparse methods for supervised learning aim at finding good linear predictors from as few variables as possible, i.e., with small cardinality of their supports. This combinatorial selection problem is often turned into a convex optimization problem by replacing the cardinality function by its convex envelope (tightest convex lower bound), in this case the L1-norm. In this paper, we investigate more general set-functions than the cardinality, that may incorporate prior knowledge or structural constraints which are common in many applications: namely, we show that for nondecreasing submodular set-functions, the corresponding convex envelope can be obtained from its $\backslash$lova extension, a common tool in submodular analysis. This defines a family of polyhedral norms, for which we provide generic algorithmic tools (subgradients and proximal operators) and theoretical results (conditions for support recovery or high-dimensional inference). By selecting specific submodular functions, we can give a new interpretation to known norms, such as those based on rank-statistics or grouped norms with potentially overlapping groups; we also define new norms, in particular ones that can be used as non-factorial priors for supervised learning.},

In this view, the difference between mean-field methods and belief propagation is not the amount of structure they model, but only the measure of loss they minimize (`exclusive' versus `inclusive' Kullback-Leibler divergence). In each case, message-passing arises by minimizing a localized version of the divergence, local to each factor. By examining these divergence measures, we can intuit the types of solution they prefer (symmetry-breaking, for example) and their suitability for different tasks. Furthermore, by considering a wider variety of divergence measures (such as alpha-divergences), we can achieve different complexity and performance goals.},

@article{Witten2011,
abstract = {We consider the supervised classification setting, in which the data consist of p features measured on n observations, each of which belongs to one of K classes. Linear discriminant analysis (LDA) is a classical method for this problem. However, in the high-dimensional setting where p ≫ n, LDA is not appropriate for two reasons. First, the standard estimate for the within-class covariance matrix is singular, and so the usual discriminant rule cannot be applied. Second, when p is large, it is difficult to interpret the classification rule obtained from LDA, since it involves all p features. We propose penalized LDA, a general approach for penalizing the discriminant vectors in Fisher's discriminant problem in a way that leads to greater interpretability. The discriminant problem is not convex, so we use a minorization-maximization approach in order to efficiently optimize it when convex penalties are applied to the discriminant vectors. In particular, we consider the use of L(1) and fused lasso penalties. Our proposal is equivalent to recasting Fisher's discriminant problem as a biconvex problem. We evaluate the performances of the resulting methods on a simulation study, and on three gene expression data sets. We also survey past methods for extending LDA to the high-dimensional setting, and explore their relationships with our proposal.},

We argue that the most successful forms of Bayesian statistics do not actually support that particular philosophy but rather accord much better with sophisticated forms of hypothetico-deductivism. We examine the actual role played by prior distributions in Bayesian models, and the crucial aspects of model checking and model revision, which fall outside the scope of Bayesian confirmation theory. We draw on the literature on the consistency of Bayesian updating and also on our experience of applied work in social science. Clarity about these matters should benefit not just philosophy of science, but also statistical practice. At best, the inductivist view has encouraged researchers to fit and compare models without checking them; at worst, theorists have actively discouraged practitioners from performing model checking because it does not fit into their framework.},

@article{Wang2016a,
abstract = {In adaptive data analysis, the user makes a sequence of queries on the data, where at each step the choice of query may depend on the results in previous steps. The releases are often randomized in order to reduce overfitting for such adaptively chosen queries. In this paper, we propose a minimax framework for adaptive data analysis. Assuming Gaussianity of queries, we establish the first sharp minimax lower bound on the squared error in the order of {\$}O(\backslashfrac{\{}\backslashsqrt{\{}k{\}}\backslashsigma{\^{}}2{\}}{\{}n{\}}){\$}, where {\$}k{\$} is the number of queries asked, and {\$}\backslashsigma{\^{}}2/n{\$} is the ordinary signal-to-noise ratio for a single query. Our lower bound is based on the construction of an approximately least favorable adversary who picks a sequence of queries that are most likely to be affected by overfitting. This approximately least favorable adversary uses only one level of adaptivity, suggesting that the minimax risk for 1-step adaptivity with k-1 initial releases and that for {\$}k{\$}-step adaptivity are on the same order. The key technical component of the lower bound proof is a reduction to finding the convoluting distribution that optimally obfuscates the sign of a Gaussian signal. Our lower bound construction also reveals a transparent and elementary proof of the matching upper bound as an alternative approach to Russo and Zou (2015), who used information-theoretic tools to provide the same upper bound. We believe that the proposed framework opens up opportunities to obtain theoretical insights for many other settings of adaptive data analysis, which would extend the idea to more practical realms.},

Surgical resection of the lesion is the most effective treatment to stop seizures. Technical advances in MRI have revolutionized the diagnosis of FCD, leading to high success rates for resective surgery. However, 45{\%} of histologically confirmed FCD patients have normal MRIs (MRI-negative). Without a visible lesion, the success rate of surgery drops from 66{\%} to 29{\%}. In this work, we cast the problem of detecting potential FCD lesions using MRI scans of MRI-negative patients in an image segmentation framework based on hierarchical conditional random fields (HCRF). We use surface based morphometry to model the cortical surface as a two-dimensional surface which is then segmented at multiple scales to extract superpixels of different sizes. Each superpixel is assigned an outlier score by comparing it to a control c Bilal Ahmed et al..},

abstract = {The k-means method is a widely used clustering technique that seeks to minimize the average squared distance between points in the same cluster. Although it offers no accuracy guarantees, its simplicity and speed are very appealing in practice. By augmenting k-means with a very simple, ran- domized seeding technique, we obtain an algorithm that is $\Theta$(log k)-competitive with the optimal clustering. Prelim- inary experiments show that our augmentation improves both the speed and the accuracy of k-means, often quite dramatically.},

abstract = {The Hidden Markov Model (HMM) is one of the mainstays of statistical modeling of discrete time series, with applications including speech recognition, computational biology, computer vision and econometrics. Estimating an HMM from its observation process is often addressed via the Baum-Welch algorithm, which is known to be susceptible to local optima. In this paper, we first give a general characterization of the basin of attraction associated with any global optimum of the population likelihood. By exploiting this characterization, we provide non-asymptotic finite sample guarantees on the Baum-Welch updates, guaranteeing geometric convergence to a small ball of radius on the order of the minimax rate around a global optimum. As a concrete example, we prove a linear rate of convergence for a hidden Markov mixture of two isotropic Gaussians given a suitable mean separation and an initialization within a ball of large radius around (one of) the true parameters. To our knowledge, these are the first rigorous local convergence guarantees to global optima for the Baum-Welch algorithm in a setting where the likelihood function is nonconvex. We complement our theoretical results with thorough numerical simulations studying the convergence of the Baum-Welch algorithm and illustrating the accuracy of our predictions.},

abstract = {It is common to summarize statistical comparisons by declarations of statistical significance or nonsignificance. Here we discuss one problem with such declarations, namely that changes in statistical significance are often not themselves statistically significant. By this, we are not merely making the commonplace observation that any particular threshold is arbitrary?for example, only a small change is required to move an estimate from a 5.1{\%} significance level to 4.9{\%}, thus moving it into statistical significance. Rather, we are pointing out that even large changes in significance levels can correspond to small, nonsignificant changes in the underlying quantities.The error we describe is conceptually different from other oft-cited problems?that statistical significance is not the same as practical importance, that dichotomization into significant and nonsignificant results encourages the dismissal of observed differences in favor of the usually less interesting null hypothesis of no difference, and that any particular threshold for declaring significance is arbitrary. We are troubled by all of these concerns and do not intend to minimize their importance. Rather, our goal is to bring attention to this additional error of interpretation. We illustrate with a theoretical example and two applied examples. The ubiquity of this statistical error leads us to suggest that students and practitioners be made more aware that the difference between ?significant? and ?not significant? is not itself statistically significant.

The ubiquity of this statistical error leads us to suggest that students and practitioners be made more aware that the difference between ?significant? and ?not significant? is not itself statistically significant.},

For classification, there already exist procedures that allow to not classify data when the confidence in their prediction is weak. This approach is known as classification with reject option. In the present paper, we provide new methodology for this approach. Predicting a new instance via a confidence set, we ensure an exact control of the probability of classification. Moreover, we show that this methodology is easily implementable and entails attractive theoretical and numerical properties.},

With small samples these rates need to be estimated from the training data, so a natural question arises: How well do the estimates of the AUC, TPR and FPR compare with the true metrics?},

As an alternative, we present the Bag of Lit- tle Bootstraps (BLB), a new procedure which incorporates features of both the bootstrap and subsampling to obtain a robust, compu- tationally efficient means of assessing estima- tor quality. BLB is well suited to modern par- allel and distributed computing architectures and retains the generic applicability, statisti- cal efficiency, and favorable theoretical prop- erties of the bootstrap. We provide the re- sults of an extensive empirical and theoretical investigation of BLB's behavior, including a study of its statistical correctness, its large- scale implementation and performance, selec- tion of hyperparameters, and performance on real data. 1.},

Universum data, which do not belong to either class of interest, have been illustrated to encode some prior knowledge by representing meaningful concepts in the same domain as the problem at hand. Our new method is applied to seek more reliable positive and negative examples from the unlabeled dataset step by step, and the Universum support vector machine(U-SVM) is used iteratively. Different Universum data will result in different performance, so several effective approaches are explored to construct Universum datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that appropriately constructed Universum will improve the accuracy and reduce the number of iterations.},

abstract = {In order to study the molecular biological differences between normal and diseased tissues, it is desirable to perform classification among diseases and stages of disease using microarray-based gene-expression values. Owing to the limited number of microarrays typically used in these studies, serious issues arise with respect to the design, performance and analysis of classifiers based on microarray data. This paper reviews some fundamental issues facing small-sample classification: classification rules, constrained classifiers, error estimation and feature selection. It discusses both unconstrained and constrained classifier design from sample data, and the contributions to classifier error from constrained optimization and lack of optimality owing to design from sample data. The difficulty with estimating classifier error when confined to small samples is addressed, particularly estimating the error from training data. The impact of small samples on the ability to include more than a few variables as classifier features is explained.},

abstract = {Improvement guarantees for semi-supervised classifiers can currently only be given under restrictive conditions on the data. We propose a general way to perform semi-supervised parameter estimation for likelihood-based classifiers for which, on the full training set, the estimates are never worse than the supervised solution in terms of the log-likelihood. We argue, moreover, that we may expect these solutions to really improve upon the supervised classifier in particular cases. In a worked-out example for LDA, we take it one step further and essentially prove that its semi-supervised version is strictly better than its supervised counterpart. The two new concepts that form the core of our estimation principle are contrast and pessimism. The former refers to the fact that our objective function takes the supervised estimates into account, enabling the semi-supervised solution to explicitly control the potential improvements over this estimate. The latter refers to the fact that our estimates are conservative and therefore resilient to whatever form the true labeling of the unlabeled data takes on. Experiments demonstrate the improvements in terms of both the log-likelihood and the classification error rate on independent test sets.},

It is shown that by these techniques a smooth transition can be made between the nearest mean classifier and the Fisher discriminant based on large samples sizes.

We relate the privileged information to importance weighting and show that the prior knowledge expressible with privileged features can also be encoded by weights associated with every training example. We show that a weighted SVM can always replicate an SV M+ solution, while the converse is not true and we construct a counterexample highlighting the limitations of SV M+. Finally, we touch on the problem of choosing weights for weighted SVMs when privileged features are not available. ?? 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

We show that many existing neural network and mean-field theory algorithms are also examples of CCCP. The generalized iterative scaling algorithm and Sinkhorn's algorithm can also be expressed as CCCP by changing variables.

abstract = {We argue that the words " objectivity " and " subjectivity " in statistics discourse are used in a mostly unhelpful way, and we propose to replace each of them with broader collections of attributes, with objectivity replaced by transparency, consensus, impartiality, and correspon-dence to observable reality, and subjectivity replaced by awareness of multiple perspectives and context dependence. The advantage of these reformulations is that the replacement terms do not oppose each other. Instead of debating over whether a given statistical method is subjec-tive or objective (or normatively debating the relative merits of subjectivity and objectivity in statistical practice), we can recognize desirable attributes such as transparency and acknowledg-ment of multiple perspectives as complementary goals. We demonstrate the implications of our proposal with recent applied examples from pharmacology, election polling, and socioeconomic stratification.},

abstract = {Despite their theoretical appeal and grounding in tractable convex optimization techniques, kernel methods are often not the first choice for large-scale speech applications due to their significant memory requirements and computational expense. In recent years, randomized approximate feature maps have emerged as an elegant mechanism to scale-up kernel methods. Still, in practice, a large number of random features is required to obtain acceptable accuracy in predictive tasks. In this paper, we develop two algorithmic schemes to address this computational bottleneck in the context of kernel ridge regression. The first scheme is a specialized distributed block coordinate descent procedure that avoids the explicit materialization of the feature space data matrix, while the second scheme gains efficiency by combining multiple weak random feature models in an ensemble learning framework. We demonstrate that these schemes enable kernel methods to match the performance of state of the art Deep Neural Networks on TIMIT for speech recognition and classification tasks. In particular, we obtain the best classification error rates reported on TIMIT using kernel methods.},

@article{Calandriello2016,
abstract = {While the harmonic function solution performs well in many semi-supervised learning (SSL) tasks, it is known to scale poorly with the number of samples. Recent successful and scalable methods, such as the eigenfunction method focus on efficiently approximating the whole spectrum of the graph Laplacian constructed from the data. This is in contrast to various subsampling and quantization methods proposed in the past, which may fail in preserving the graph spectra. However, the impact of the approximation of the spectrum on the final generalization error is either unknown, or requires strong assumptions on the data. In this paper, we introduce Sparse-HFS, an efficient edge-sparsification algorithm for SSL. By constructing an edge-sparse and spectrally similar graph, we are able to leverage the approximation guarantees of spectral sparsification methods to bound the generalization error of Sparse-HFS. As a result, we obtain a theoretically-grounded approximation scheme for graph-based SSL that also empirically matches the performance of known large-scale methods.},

abstract = {One of the core problems of modern statistics is to approximate difficult-to-compute probability distributions. This problem is especially important in Bayesian statistics, which frames all inference about unknown quantities as a calculation about the posterior. In this paper, we review variational inference (VI), a method from machine learning that approximates probability distributions through optimization. VI has been used in myriad applications and tends to be faster than classical methods, such as Markov chain Monte Carlo sampling. The idea behind VI is to first posit a family of distributions and then to find the member of that family which is close to the target. Closeness is measured by Kullback-Leibler divergence. We review the ideas behind mean-field variational inference, discuss the special case of VI applied to exponential family models, present a full example with a Bayesian mixture of Gaussians, and derive a variant that uses stochastic optimization to scale up to massive data. We discuss modern research in VI and highlight important open problems. VI is powerful, but it is not yet well understood. Our hope in writing this paper is to catalyze statistical research on this widely-used class of algorithms.},

abstract = {In distributed learning, the goal is to perform a learning task over data distributed across multiple nodes with minimal (expensive) communication. Prior work (Daume III et al., 2012) proposes a general model that bounds the communication required for learning classifiers while allowing for {\$}\backslasheps{\$} training error on linearly separable data adversarially distributed across nodes. In this work, we develop key improvements and extensions to this basic model. Our first result is a two-party multiplicative-weight-update based protocol that uses {\$}O(d{\^{}}2 \backslashlog{\{}1/\backslasheps{\}}){\$} words of communication to classify distributed data in arbitrary dimension {\$}d{\$}, {\$}\backslasheps{\$}-optimally. This readily extends to classification over {\$}k{\$} nodes with {\$}O(kd{\^{}}2 \backslashlog{\{}1/\backslasheps{\}}){\$} words of communication. Our proposed protocol is simple to implement and is considerably more efficient than baselines compared, as demonstrated by our empirical results. In addition, we illustrate general algorithm design paradigms for doing efficient learning over distributed data. We show how to solve fixed-dimensional and high dimensional linear programming efficiently in a distributed setting where constraints may be distributed across nodes. Since many learning problems can be viewed as convex optimization problems where constraints are generated by individual points, this models many typical distributed learning scenarios. Our techniques make use of a novel connection from multipass streaming, as well as adapting the multiplicative-weight-update framework more generally to a distributed setting. As a consequence, our methods extend to the wide range of problems solvable using these techniques.},

abstract = {The problem of characterizing learnability is the most basic question of statistical learning theory. A fun-damental and long-standing answer, at least for the case of supervised classification and regression, is that learnability is equivalent to uniform convergence of the empirical risk to the population risk, and that if a problem is learnable, it is learnable via empirical risk minimization. In this paper, we consider the General Learning Setting (introduced by Vapnik), which includes most statistical learning problems as special cases. We show that in this setting, there are non-trivial learning problems where uniform convergence does not hold, empirical risk minimization fails, and yet they are learnable using alternative mechanisms. Instead of uniform convergence, we identify stability as the key necessary and sufficient condition for learnability. More-over, we show that the conditions for learnability in the general setting are significantly more complex than in supervised classification and regression.},

@article{Poggio2004,
abstract = {Developing theoretical foundations for learning is a key step towards understanding intelligence. 'Learning from examples' is a paradigm in which systems (natural or artificial) learn a functional relationship from a training set of examples. Within this paradigm, a learning algorithm is a map from the space of training sets to the hypothesis space of possible functional solutions. A central question for the theory is to determine conditions under which a learning algorithm will generalize from its finite training set to novel examples. A milestone in learning theory was a characterization of conditions on the hypothesis space that ensure generalization for the natural class of empirical risk minimization (ERM) learning algorithms that are based on minimizing the error on the training set. Here we provide conditions for generalization in terms of a precise stability property of the learning process: when the training set is perturbed by deleting one example, the learned hypothesis does not change much. This stability property stipulates conditions on the learning map rather than on the hypothesis space, subsumes the classical theory for ERM algorithms, and is applicable to more general algorithms. The surprising connection between stability and predictivity has implications for the foundations of learning theory and for the design of novel algorithms, and provides insights into problems as diverse as language learning and inverse problems in physics and engineering.},

abstract = {We formalize the idea of probability distributions that lead to reliable predictions about some, but not all aspects of a domain. The resulting notion of `safety' provides a fresh perspective on foundational issues in statistics, providing a middle ground between imprecise probability and multiple-prior models on the one hand and strictly Bayesian approaches on the other. It also allows us to formalize fiducial distributions in terms of the set of random variables that they can safely predict, thus taking some of the sting out of the fiducial idea. By restricting probabilistic inference to safe uses, one also automatically avoids paradoxes such as the Monty Hall problem. Safety comes in a variety of degrees, such as "validity" (the strongest notion), "calibration", "confidence safety" and "unbiasedness" (almost the weakest notion).},

abstract = {Reliable semi-supervised learning, where a small amount of labelled data is complemented by a large body of unlabelled data, has been a long-standing goal of the machine learning community. However, while it seems intuitively obvious that unlabelled data can aid the learning process, in practise its performance has often been disappointing. We investigate this by examining generative maximum likelihood semi-supervised learning and derive novel upper and lower bounds on the degree of bias introduced by the unlabelled data. These bounds improve upon those provided in previous work, and are specifically applicable to the challenging case where the model is unable to exactly fit to the underlying distribution a situation which is common in practise, but for which fewer guarantees of semi-supervised performance have been found. Inspired by this new framework for analysing bounds, we propose a new, simple reweighing scheme which provides a provably unbiased estimator for arbitrary model/distribution pairs|an unusual property for a semi-supervised algorithm. This reweighing introduces no additional computational complexity and can be applied to very many models. Additionally, we provide specific conditions demonstrating the circumstance under which the unlabelled data will lower the estimator variance, thereby improving convergence. {\textcopyright} 2014 Patrick Fox-Roberts and Edward Rosten.},

Our analysis is divided into two parts: a treatment of these algorithms at the population level (in the limit of infinite data), followed by results that apply to updates based on a finite set of samples. First, we characterize the domain of attraction of any global maximizer of the population likelihood. This characterization is based on a novel view of the EM updates as a perturbed form of likelihood ascent, or in parallel, of the gradient EM updates as a perturbed form of standard gradient ascent. Leveraging this characterization, we then provide non-asymptotic guarantees on the EM and gradient EM algorithms when applied to a finite set of samples. We develop consequences of our general theory for three canonical examples of incomplete-data problems: mixture of Gaussians, mixture of regressions, and linear regression with covariates missing completely at random. In each case, our theory guarantees that with a suitable initialization, a relatively small number of EM (or gradient EM) steps will yield (with high probability) an estimate that is within statistical error of the MLE. We provide simulations to confirm this theoretically predicted behavior.},

This type of problem, a special case of semi-supervised data, is common in text mining, bioinformatics, and computer vision. Focusing on a generalised likelihood ratio test, we have 3 key contributions: (1) a proof that assuming all unlabelled examples are negative cases is sufficient for independence testing, but not for power analysis activities; (2) a new methodology that compensates this and enables power analysis, allowing sample size determination for observing an effect with a desired power; and finally, (3) a new capability, supervision determination, which can determine a-priori the number of labelled examples the user must collect before being able to observe a desired statistical effect. Beyond general hypothesis testing, we suggest the tools will additionally be useful for information theoretic feature selection, and Bayesian Network structure learning. {\textcopyright} 2014 Springer-Verlag.},

abstract = {The clinical heterogeneity of Parkinson's disease (PD) may point at the existence of subtypes. Because subtypes likely reflect distinct underlying etiologies, their identification may facilitate future genetic and pharmacotherapeutic studies. Aim of this study was to identify subtypes by a data-driven approach applied to a broad spectrum of motor and nonmotor features of PD. Data of motor and nonmotor PD symptoms were collected in 802 patients in two different European prevalent cohorts. A model-based cluster analysis was conducted on baseline data of 344 patients of a Dutch cohort (PROPARK). Reproducibility of these results was tested in data of the second annual assessment of the same cohort and validated in an independent Spanish cohort (ELEP) of 357 patients. The subtypes were subsequently characterized on clinical and demographic variables. Four similar PD subtypes were identified in two different populations and are largely characterized by differences in the severity of nondopaminergic features and motor complications: Subtype 1 was mildly affected in all domains, Subtype 2 was predominantly characterized by severe motor complications, Subtype 3 was affected mainly on nondopaminergic domains without prominent motor complications, while Subtype 4 was severely affected on all domains. The subtypes had largely similar mean disease durations (nonsignificant differences between three clusters) but showed considerable differences with respect to their association with demographic and clinical variables. In prevalent disease, PD subtypes are largely characterized by the severity of nondopaminergic features and motor complications and likely reflect complex interactions between disease mechanisms, treatment, aging, and gender.},

abstract = {There is increasing concern that most current published research findings are false. The probability that a research claim is true may depend on study power and bias, the number of other studies on the same question, and, importantly, the ratio of true to no relationships among the relationships probed in each scientific field. In this framework, a research finding is less likely to be true when the studies conducted in a field are smaller; when effect sizes are smaller; when there is a greater number and lesser preselection of tested relationships; where there is greater flexibility in designs, definitions, outcomes, and analytical modes; when there is greater financial and other interest and prejudice; and when more teams are involved in a scientific field in chase of statistical significance. Simulations show that for most study designs and settings, it is more likely for a research claim to be false than true. Moreover, for many current scientific fields, claimed research findings may often be simply accurate measures of the prevailing bias. In this essay, I discuss the implications of these problems for the conduct and interpretation of research.},

abstract = {Supervised learning for classification of cancer employs a set of design examples to learn how to discriminate between tumors. In practice it is crucial to confirm that the classifier is robust with good generalization performance to new examples, or at least that it performs better than random guessing. A suggested alternative is to obtain a confidence interval of the error rate using repeated design and test sets selected from available examples. However, it is known that even in the ideal situation of repeated designs and tests with completely novel samples in each cycle, a small test set size leads to a large bias in the estimate of the true variance between design sets. Therefore different methods for small sample performance estimation such as a recently proposed procedure called Repeated Random Sampling (RSS) is also expected to result in heavily biased estimates, which in turn translates into biased confidence intervals. Here we explore such biases and develop a refined algorithm called Repeated Independent Design and Test (RIDT).},

abstract = {Digital staining for the automated annotation of mass spectrometry imaging (MSI) data has previously been achieved using state-of-the-art classifiers such as random forests or support vector machines (SVMs). However, the training of such classifiers requires an expert to label exemplary data in advance. This process is time-consuming and hence costly, especially if the tissue is heterogeneous. In theory, it may be sufficient to only label a few highly representative pixels of an MS image, but it is not known a priori which pixels to select. This motivates active learning strategies in which the algorithm itself queries the expert by automatically suggesting promising candidate pixels of an MS image for labeling. Given a suitable querying strategy, the number of required training labels can be significantly reduced while maintaining classification accuracy. In this work, we propose active learning for convenient annotation of MSI data. We generalize a recently proposed active learning method to the multiclass case and combine it with the random forest classifier. Its superior performance over random sampling is demonstrated on secondary ion mass spectrometry data, making it an interesting approach for the classification of MS images.},

abstract = {The cluster assumption had a significant impact on the reasoning behind semi-supervised classification methods in graph-based learning. The literature includes numerous applications where harmonic functions provided estimates that conformed to data satisfying this well-known assumption, but the relationship between this assumption and harmonic functions is not as well-understood theoretically. We investigate these matters from the perspective of supervised kernel classification and provide concrete answers to two fundamental questions. (i) Under what conditions do semi-supervised harmonic approaches satisfy this assumption? (ii) If such an assumption is satisfied then why precisely would an observation sacrifice its own supervised estimate in favor of the cluster? First, a harmonic function is guaranteed to assign labels to data in harmony with the cluster assumption if a specific condition on the boundary of the harmonic function is satisfied. Second, it is shown that any harmonic function estimate within the interior is a probability weighted average of supervised estimates, where the weight is focused on supervised kernel estimates near labeled cases. We demonstrate that the uniqueness criterion for harmonic estimators is sensitive when the graph is sparse or the size of the boundary is relatively small. This sets the stage for a third contribution, a new regularized joint harmonic function for semi-supervised learning based on a joint optimization criterion. Mathematical properties of this estimator, such as its uniqueness even when the graph is sparse or the size of the boundary is relatively small, are proven. A main selling point is its ability to operate in circumstances where the cluster assumption may not be fully satisfied on real data by compromising between the purely harmonic and purely supervised estimators. The competitive stature of the new regularized joint harmonic approach is established.},

Concretely, we first show that any sequence of predictors minimizing convex risk over the source distribution will converge to this unique model when the class of predictors is linear (but potentially of infinite dimension). Secondly, we show the same result holds for $\backslash$emph{\{}empirical{\}} risk minimization whenever this class of predictors is finite dimensional, where the essential technical contribution is a norm-free generalization bound.},

abstract = {The discovery of causal relationships from purely observational data is a fundamental problem in science. The most elementary form of such a causal discovery problem is to decide whether X causes Y or, alternatively, Y causes X, given joint observations of two variables X,Y. An example is to decide whether altitude causes temperature, or vice versa, given only joint measurements of both variables. Even under the simplifying assumptions of causal sufficiency, no feedback loops, and no selection bias, such bivariate causal discovery problems are very challenging. Nevertheless, several approaches for addressing those problems have been proposed in recent years. We review two families of such methods: Additive Noise Methods (ANM) and Information Geometric Causal Inference (IGCI). We present the benchmark CauseEffectPairs that consists of data for 96 different cause-effect pairs selected from 34 datasets from various domains (e.g., meteorology, biology, medicine, engineering, economy, etc.). We motivate our decisions regarding the "ground truth" causal directions of all pairs. We evaluate the performance of several bivariate causal discovery methods on these real-world benchmark data and in addition on artificially simulated data. Our empirical results indicate that certain methods are able to distinguish cause from effect using only purely observational data with an accuracy of 63-69{\%}. Because of multiple-testing corrections, however, considerably more benchmark data would be needed to obtain statistically significant conclusions. A theoretical contribution of this paper is a proof of the consistency of the additive-noise method as originally proposed by Hoyer et al. (2009).},

abstract = {The ever-increasing size of modern data sets combined with the difficulty of obtaining label information has made semi-supervised learning one of the problems of significant practical importance in modern data analysis. We revisit the approach to semi-supervised learning with generative models and develop new models that allow for effective generalisation from small labelled data sets to large unlabelled ones. Generative approaches have thus far been either inflexible, inefficient or non-scalable. We show that deep generative models and approximate Bayesian inference exploiting recent advances in variational methods can be used to provide significant improvements, making generative approaches highly competitive for semi-supervised learning.},

We introduce a convexity assumption, which is met by all loss functions commonly used in the literature, and study how the bound on the estimation error changes with the loss. We also derive a general result on the minimizer of the expected risk for a convex loss function in the case of classification. The main outcome of our analysis is that for classification, the hinge loss appears to be the loss of choice. Other things being equal, the hinge loss leads to a convergence rate practically indistinguishable from the logistic loss rate and much better than the square loss rate. Furthermore, if the hypothesis space is sufficiently rich, the bounds obtained for the hinge loss are not loosened by the thresholding stage.},

Six classes of procedures are distinguished: complete case analysis, available case methods, least squares on imputed data, maximum likelihood, Bayesian methods, and multiple imputation. Methods are compared and illustrated when missing data are confined to one independent variable, and extensions to more general patterns are indicated. Attention is paid to the performance of methods when the missing data are not missing completely at random. Least squares methods that fill in missing X's using only data on the X's are contrasted with likelihood-based methods that use data on the X's and Y. The latter approach is preferred and provides methods for elaboration of the basic normal linear regression model. It is suggested that more widely distributed software is needed that advances beyond complete-case analysis, available-case analysis, and naive imputation methods. Bayesian simulation methods and multiple imputation are reviewed; these provide fruitful avenues for future research.},

In contrast with other approaches dealing with similar problems, the technique developed in this article has the following advantages: (1) it is based on rather unrestrictive hypotheses; (2) the resulting estimators are consistent; (3) the asymptotic variances of these estimators are smaller than those of comparable estimators described in the literature. Although the question is not examined in the present article, it seems also that the proposed method offers good possibilities of generalization.},

abstract = {The goal of active learning is to select the most informative examples for manual labeling. Most of the previous studies in active learning have focused on selecting a single unlabeled example in each iteration. This could be ineﬃcient since the classiﬁcation model has to be retrained for every labeled example. In this paper, we present a framework for “batch mode active learning” that applies the Fisher information matrix to select a number of informative examples simultaneously. The key computational challenge is how to eﬃciently identify the subset of unlabeled examples that can result in the largest reduction in the Fisher information. To resolve this challenge, we propose an eﬃcient greedy algorithm that is based on the property of submodular functions. Our empirical studies with ﬁve UCI datasets and one realworld medical image classiﬁcation show that the proposed batch mode active learning algorithm is more eﬀective than the state-ofthe-art algorithms for active learning},

The utility of such approaches is highlighted in the software package STAN, which provides a platform for automatic implementation of general Bayesian models. Hence, methods for improving the efficiency of general Hamiltonian Monte Carlo algorithms can have a substantial impact on practice. We propose such a method in this article by recycling the intermediate leap-frog steps used in approximating the Hamiltonian trajectories. Current algorithms use only the final step, and wastefully discard all the intermediate steps. We propose a simple and provably accurate approach for using these intermediate samples, boosting the effective sample size with little programming effort and essentially no extra computational cost. We show that our recycled Hamiltonian Monte Carlo algorithm can lead to substantial gains in computational efficiency in a variety of experiments.},

abstract = {Mean shift clustering is a powerful nonparametric technique that does not require prior knowledge of the number of clusters and does not constrain the shape of the clusters. However, being completely unsupervised, its performance suffers when the original distance metric fails to capture the underlying cluster structure. Despite recent advances in semi-supervised clustering methods, there has been little effort towards incorporating supervision into mean shift. We propose a semi-supervised framework for kernel mean shift clustering (SKMS) that uses only pairwise constraints to guide the clustering procedure. The points are first mapped to a high-dimensional kernel space where the constraints are imposed by a linear transformation of the mapped points. This is achieved by modifying the initial kernel matrix by minimizing a log det divergence-based objective function.We show the advantages of SKMS by evaluating its performance on various synthetic and real datasets while comparing with state-of-the-art semi-supervised clustering algorithms.},

abstract = {We describe and develop a close relationship between two problems that have customarily been regarded as distinct: that of maximizing entropy, and that of minimizing worst-case expected loss.  Using a formulation grounded in the equilibrium theory of zero-sum games between Decision Maker and Nature, these two problems are shown to be dual to each other, the solution to each providing that to the other.  Although Topsoe described this connection for the Shannon entropy over 20 years ago, it does not appear to be widely known even in that important special case. 

We here generalize this theory to apply to arbitrary decision problems and loss functions.  We indicate how an appropriate generalized definition of entropy can be associated with such a problem, and we show that, subject to certain regularity conditions, the above-mentioned duality continues to apply in this extended context.  This simultaneously provides a possible rationale for maximizing entropy and a tool for finding robust Bayes acts.  We also describe the essential identity between the problem of maximizing entropy and that of minimizing a related discrepancy or divergence between distributions.  This leads to an extension, to arbitrary discrepancies, of a well-known minimax theorem for the case of Kullback-Leibler divergence (the "redundancy-capacity theorem'' of information theory).  For the important case of families of distributions having certain mean values specified, we develop simple sufficient conditions and methods for identifying the desired solutions.},

Observed values of the potential outcomes are revealed by the assignment mechanism—a probabilistic model for the treatment each unit receives as a function of covariates and potential outcomes. Fisher made tremendous contributions to causal inference through his work on the design of randomized experiments, but the potential outcomes perspective applies to other complex experiments and nonrandomized studies as well. As noted by Kempthorne in his 1976 discussion of Savage's Fisher lecture, Fisher never bridged his work on experimental design and his work on parametric modeling, a bridge that appears nearly automatic with an appropriate view of the potential outcomes framework, where the potential outcomes and covariates are given a Bayesian distribution to complete the model specification. Also, this framework crisply separates scientific inference for causal effects and decisions based on s...},

abstract = {Training object class detectors typically requires a large set of images in which objects are annotated by bounding-boxes. However, manually drawing bounding-boxes is very time consuming. We propose a new scheme for training object detectors which only requires annotators to verify bounding-boxes produced automatically by the learning algorithm. Our scheme iterates between re-training the detector, re-localizing objects in the training images, and human verification. We use the verification signal both to improve re-training and to reduce the search space for re-localisation, which makes these steps different to what is normally done in a weakly supervised setting. Extensive experiments on PASCAL VOC 2007 show that (1) using human verification to update detectors and reduce the search space leads to the rapid production of high-quality bounding-box annotations; (2) our scheme delivers detectors performing almost as good as those trained in a fully supervised setting, without ever drawing any bounding-box; (3) as the verification task is very quick, our scheme substantially reduces total annotation time by a factor 6x-9x.},

abstract = {This letter presents a semisupervised method based on kernel machines and graph theory for remote sensing image classification. The support vector machine (SVM) is regularized with the unnormalized graph Laplacian, thus leading to the Laplacian SVM (LapSVM). The method is tested in the challenging problems of urban monitoring and cloud screening, in which an adequate exploitation of the wealth of unlabeled samples is critical. Results obtained using different sensors, and with low number of training samples, demonstrate the potential of the proposed LapSVM for remote sensing image classification.},

abstract = {The clinical variability between patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) may point at the existence of subtypes of the disease. Identification of subtypes is important, since a focus on homogeneous groups may enhance the chance of success of research on mechanisms of disease and may also lead to tailored treatment strategies. Cluster analysis (CA) is an objective method to classify patients into subtypes. We systematically reviewed the methodology and results of CA studies in PD to gain a better understanding of the robustness of identified subtypes. We found seven studies that fulfilled the inclusion criteria. Studies were limited by incomplete reporting and methodological limitations. Differences between studies rendered comparisons of the results difficult. However, it appeared that studies which applied a comparable design identified similar subtypes. The cluster profiles "old age-at-onset and rapid disease progression" and "young age-at-onset and slow disease progression" emerged from the majority of studies. Other cluster profiles were less consistent across studies. Future studies with a rigorous study design that is standardized with respect to the included variables, data processing, and CA technique may advance the knowledge on subtypes in PD.},

Kleinberg's theory of stochastic discrimination (SD) addresses this rigorously via mathematical notions of enrichment, uniformity, and projectability of an ensemble. We explain these concepts via a very simple numerical example that captures the basic principles of the SD theory and method. We focus on a fundamental symmetry in point set covering that is the key observation leading to the foundation of the theory. We believe a better understanding of the SD method will lead to developments of better tools for analyzing other ensemble methods.},

abstract = {Modern massive datasets create a fundamental problem at the intersection of the computational and statistical sciences: how to provide guarantees on the quality of statistical inference given bounds on computational resources, such as time or space. Our approach to this problem is to define a notion of "algorithmic weakening," in which a hierarchy of algorithms is ordered by both computational efficiency and statistical efficiency, allowing the growing strength of the data at scale to be traded off against the need for sophisticated processing. We illustrate this approach in the setting of denoising problems, using convex relaxation as the core inferential tool. Hierarchies of convex relaxations have been widely used in theoretical computer science to yield tractable approximation algorithms to many computationally intractable tasks. In the current paper, we show how to endow such hierarchies with a statistical characterization and thereby obtain concrete tradeoffs relating algorithmic runtime to amount of data.},

abstract = {Author name disambiguation in bibliographic databases is the problem of grouping together scientific publications written by the same person, accounting for potential homonyms and/or synonyms. Among solutions to this problem, digital libraries are increasingly offering tools for authors to manually curate their publications and claim those that are theirs. Indirectly, these tools allow for the inexpensive collection of large annotated training data, which can be further leveraged to build a complementary automated disambiguation system capable of inferring patterns for identifying publications written by the same person. Building on more than 1 million publicly released crowdsourced annotations, we propose an automated author disambiguation solution exploiting this data (i) to learn an accurate classifier for identifying coreferring authors and (ii) to guide the clustering of scientific publications by distinct authors in a semi-supervised way. To the best of our knowledge, our analysis is the first to be carried out on data of this size and coverage. With respect to the state of the art, we validate the general pipeline used in most existing solutions, and improve by: (i) proposing phonetic-based blocking strategies, thereby increasing recall; and (ii) adding strong ethnicity-sensitive features for learning a linkage function, thereby tailoring disambiguation to non-Western author names whenever necessary.},

In addition, it can be used for histograms on non-standard domains like circles, revealing a strategy for manifold-valued semi-supervised learning.

In particular, this is true if A is cross-validation and B is “anti-cross-validation” (choose the learning algorithm with largest cross-validation error). This paper ends with a discussion of the implications of these results for computational learning theory. It is shown that one can not say: if empirical misclassification rate is low; the {\{}Vapnik-Chervonenkis{\}} dimension of your generalizer is small; and the training set is large, then with high probability your {\{}OTS{\}} error is small. Other implications for “membership queries” algorithms and “punting” algorithms are also discussed.},

Here we lay out fast and stable computations for LOO and WAIC that can be performed using existing simulation draws.

As a byproduct of our calculations, we also obtain approximate standard errors for estimated predictive errors and for comparing of predictive errors between two models.

@article{Braga-Neto2004,
abstract = {MOTIVATION: Microarray classification typically possesses two striking attributes: (1) classifier design and error estimation are based on remarkably small samples and (2) cross-validation error estimation is employed in the majority of the papers. Thus, it is necessary to have a quantifiable understanding of the behavior of cross-validation in the context of very small samples. RESULTS: An extensive simulation study has been performed comparing cross-validation, resubstitution and bootstrap estimation for three popular classification rules-linear discriminant analysis, 3-nearest-neighbor and decision trees (CART)-using both synthetic and real breast-cancer patient data. Comparison is via the distribution of differences between the estimated and true errors. Various statistics for the deviation distribution have been computed: mean (for estimator bias), variance (for estimator precision), root-mean square error (for composition of bias and variance) and quartile ranges, including outlier behavior. In general, while cross-validation error estimation is much less biased than resubstitution, it displays excessive variance, which makes individual estimates unreliable for small samples. Bootstrap methods provide improved performance relative to variance, but at a high computational cost and often with increased bias (albeit, much less than with resubstitution).},

abstract = {Basketball is a game of decisions; at any moment, a player can change the character of a possession by choosing to pass, dribble, or shoot. The current state of basketball analytics, however, provides no way to quantitatively evaluate the vast majority of decisions that players make, as most metrics are driven by events that occur at or near the end of a possession, such as points, turnovers, and assists. We propose a framework for using plater-tracking data to assign a point value to each moment of a possession by computing how many points the offense is expected to score by the end of the possession, a quantity we call expected possession value (EPV). EPV allows analysts to evaluate every decision made during a basketball game - whether it is to pass, dribble, or shoot - opening the door for a multitude of new metrics and analyses of basketball that quantify value in terms of points. In this paper, we propose a modeling framework for estimating EPV, present results of EPV computations performed using player-tracking data from the 2012-2013 season, adn provide several examples of EPV-derived metrics that answer real basketball questions.},
